Each week I humbly tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that‚Äôs stressing you out about work.If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, here‚Äôs what you missed this month:Growth inflectionsHow to be prepared for layoffsHow Coda builds productSubscribe to get access to these posts, and every post.SubscribeI was at a small event a few months back where Jorge Mazal (former CPO of Duolingo) shared the story behind Duolingo‚Äôs growth reaccelerating. I was captivated. I‚Äôve never seen a growth story like this before‚Äî4.5x growth for a mature product, driven by a small handful of product changes, rooted in an innovative growth model, and explained in such actionable detail. I asked Jorge if he‚Äôd be willing to share (and expand on) the story with a broader audience, and I‚Äôm so happy he agreed. Many products already look to Duolingo for inspiration, and I suspect this story will only increase that trend. Enjoy!Follow Jorge for more on LinkedIn and Twitter.I joined Duolingo as the Head of Product in late 2017. Duolingo was already the most downloaded education app in the world, with hundreds of millions of users, fulfilling its mission to ‚Äúdevelop the best education in the world and make it universally available.‚Äù However, user growth was slowing down. By mid-2018, daily active users (DAU) were growing at a single-digit rate year-over-year, which was troubling, given the explosive growth the company had seen in the past. This was a problem for a startup with investors anxious to see fast monetization growth.In this post I‚Äôll cover some of our early failures and then our first big wins that helped us turn around growth, including launching leaderboards, refocusing on push notifications, and optimizing the ‚Äústreak‚Äù feature. These, together with several other efforts across Product and Marketing, helped us grow DAU by 4.5x over four years. Robust organic user growth supercharged Duolingo toward its 2021 IPO.This article is an in-depth look into that journey. It is my hope that sharing this work will help others find their own growth breakthroughs faster.Phase 1: Increasing gamificationOur first attempt at reigniting growth was focused on improving retention, i.e. fixing our ‚Äúleaky bucket‚Äù problem. We prioritized working on retention over new-user acquisition because all of our new-user acquisition was organic, and, at the time, we didn‚Äôt have an obvious lever to pull to supercharge that. Also, some of us had a suspicion that we could improve retention through gamification. There were two main reasons why this felt like the right approach to me. First, Duolingo had already implemented several gamification mechanics successfully, such as the progression system on the home screen, streaks, and an achievements system. And second, top digital games at the time had much higher retention rates than our product, which I took as evidence that we hadn‚Äôt yet reached the ceiling for gamification‚Äôs impact.¬†Duolingo‚Äôs gamified Home and Achievements pagesArmed with a short presentation I co-created with our chief designer, we were able to get just enough buy-in from the rest of the executive team to create a new team, the Gamification Team. The team consisted of an engineering manager, an engineer, a designer, an APM, and me.But there was one small issue: we had no idea which incremental gamification mechanics would work for Duolingo.Our team at the time was hooked on a game called Gardenscapes, a mobile, match-3 puzzle game similar to Candy Crush. This mobile game became our first inspiration.¬†A Gardenscapes match-3 puzzle levelAs we looked at the different game mechanics in Gardenscapes, we didn‚Äôt really know what we were looking for‚Äîwe just knew that Gardenscapes seemed stickier than Duolingo, and we saw several parallels. A three-minute Duolingo lesson felt similar to a Gardenscapes match-3 level, and Duolingo and Gardenscapes both used progress bars to provide visual feedback on how close the user was to completing the session. Gardenscapes, however, paired its progress bar with a moves counter, which Duolingo didn‚Äôt do. The moves counter allowed users only a finite number of moves to complete a level, which added a sense of scarcity and urgency to the gameplay. We decided to incorporate the counter mechanic into our product. We gave our users a finite number of chances to answer questions correctly before they had to start the lesson over.It took our team a couple of months of work to add the counter. With the release of the update, I expectantly waited for an unmitigated success. Depressingly, the result of all that effort was completely neutral. No change to our retention. No increase in DAU. We hardly got any user feedback at all. I was deflated. The greatest effect the initiative had was on our team. After the results came out, we quickly fell into dissension. Some wanted to continue iterating on the idea, while others wanted to pivot. The team almost immediately (and dramatically) disbanded, and the idea was abandoned. It was pretty awful. The one silver lining of this failure was that I learned a lot about the company culture and about how to improve my personal leadership style‚Äîthough that‚Äôs for a different article.The first attempt to reignite growth through more gamification resulted in a dumpster fire.Phase 2: ReferralsFeeling burned after our gamification effort, we completely pivoted away from improving retention and put together a new product team focused on acquiring new users, called the Acquisition Team. At the time, Uber was doing well with user acquisition and had reputedly grown largely because of its referral program. Inspired by this, we created a referral program similar to Uber‚Äôs. The reward was a free month of our premium subscription, Super Duolingo (at the time, it was called Duolingo Plus). Seemed like a pretty good offer to us!¬†We implemented the feature and hoped our second attempt would be more successful. Instead, new users increased by only 3%. It was positive, but not the type of breakthrough we needed. Still, the team doubled down and pushed through, shipping iterations to the referral program and making some other bets, but no avail.While the team continued to iterate, it became clear to me that we had to find a different approach to tackle our growth problem.¬†¬†¬†Time to regroupThe aftermath of these back-to-back failures in only a few months was a period of reflection for me about making better product bets.¬†In hindsight, it became clear why the Gardenscapes moves counter was not a good fit for our product. When you are playing Gardenscapes, each move feels like a strategic decision, because you have to outmaneuver dynamic obstacles to find a path to victory. But strategic decision-making isn‚Äôt required to complete a Duolingo lesson‚Äîyou mostly either know the answer to a question or you don‚Äôt. Because there wasn‚Äôt any strategy to it, the Duolingo moves counter was simply a boring, tacked-on nuisance. It was the wrong gamification mechanic to adopt into Duolingo. I realized that I had been so focused on the similarities between Gardenscapes and Duolingo that I had failed to account for the importance of the underlying differences.¬†It also did not take long to understand why our referral program did not produce Uber-like success. Referrals work for Uber because riders are paying for rides on a never-ending pay-as-you-go system. A free ride is a constant incentive. For Duolingo, we were trying to incentivize users by offering a free month of Super Duolingo. However, our best and most active users already had Super Duolingo, and we couldn‚Äôt give them a free month when they were already in a plan. This meant that our strategy, which needed to rely on our best users, actually excluded them.In both of these situations, we had borrowed successful features from other products, but the wrong way. We had failed to account for how a change in context can impact the success of a feature. I came away from these attempts realizing that I needed a better understanding of how to borrow ideas from other products intelligently. Now when looking to adopt a feature, I ask myself:Why is this feature working in that product?Why might this feature succeed or fail in our context, i.e. will it translate well?What adaptations are necessary to make this feature succeed in our context?In other words, we needed to use better judgment in adapting when adopting. Being more systematic in just this area would have made a big difference in what gamification mechanics we chose to pursue. And we would have probably been dissuaded from focusing on referrals altogether. I was committed to making sure our next attempts would be more methodical. We needed to be better at basing our decisions on data, insights, and foundational principles.¬†Phase 3: Using data and modelsDuolingo has always excelled at collecting data, especially in support of A/B testing. But there hadn‚Äôt been much effort put into using the data for insights generation. Having seen from the inside how Zynga and MyFitnessPal used data, I felt we could use Duolingo‚Äôs data to find a North Star metric and get the breakthrough we needed.¬†My time at Zynga and MyFitnessPal gave us inspiration on how to segment and model our users by engagement level. Zynga separated their users and measured retention based on the following weekly retention metrics:Current users retention rate (CURR): The chance a user comes back this week if they came to the product each of the past two weeks¬†New users retention rate (NURR): The chance a user comes back this week if they were new to the product last week¬†Reactivated user retention rates (RURR): The chance a user comes back this week if they reactivated last weekLater, when I worked at MyFitnessPal, I found that they had adopted and expanded Zynga‚Äôs retention work. They not only used CURR, NURR, and RURR to measure growth but also to model future scenarios. They also added SURR:Resurrected user retention rate (SURR): The chance a user comes back this week if they resurrected (from a longer absence) last weekI hypothesized that we could use these metrics at Duolingo as a starting point to create a more sophisticated model, and use that model to identify a North Star metric. Working with the data scientist and the engineer manager in the Acquisition Team, we came up with the model below. We used the same retention rates as Zynga and MyFitnessPal, but we tweaked from a weekly view to a daily view and we added several more metrics.The blocks, or buckets, represent different user segments with different levels of engagement. And every single user who has ever used the product is in one, and only one, bucket on any given day. That means the buckets in the model are MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive) in representing the entire base of users who have ever used Duolingo. The arrows measure the movement of users between the buckets (these include CURR, NURR, RURR, and SURR, but evolved into daily retention rates rather than weekly). Combining the buckets and the arrows, the model creates an almost closed-circuit system, with new users being the only break.¬†Conveniently, the top four buckets of the model add up to DAU. Those buckets are defined as:¬†New users: first day of engagement ever in the appCurrent users: engaged today and at least one other time in the prior 6 daysReactivated users: first day of engagement after being away for 7-29 daysResurrected users: first day of engagement after being away for 30 days or longerThe remaining three buckets represent users who were not active today and have different degrees of inactivity.At-risk WAU: inactive today, but active in at least one of the prior 6 days¬†At-risk WAU + DAU = WAU¬†At-risk MAU: inactive in the past seven days, but active in at least one of the prior 23 days¬†At-risk MAU + WAU = MAUDormant users: inactive in the past 31 days or longer¬†MAU + dormant users =¬† Total user baseThe fact that DAU, WAU, and MAU can easily be calculated from these buckets made it easy to model them over time. This is a key feature of the model. Additionally, by manipulating the rates represented by the arrows, we can model the compounding and cumulative impact of moving these rates over time; in other words, the rates are the levers product teams can pull to grow DAU.With the model created, we started taking daily snapshots of data to create a history of how all of these user buckets and retention rates had evolved on a day-by-day basis over the past several years. With this data, we could create a forward-looking model and then perform a sensitivity analysis to predict which levers would have the biggest impact on DAU growth. We ran a simulation for each rate, where we moved a single rate 2% every quarter for three years, holding all the other rates constant.¬†Below are the results of our first simulation. It shows how those small 2% movements on each lever impacted forecasted MAU and DAU.We immediately saw that CURR had a gigantic impact on DAU‚Äî5 times the impact of the second-best metric. In hindsight, the CURR finding made sense, because the Current User bucket has an interesting characteristic: current users who stay active return to the same bucket.This produces a compounding effect, which means that CURR is much harder to move, but when it does, it will have a greater impact. Based on this analysis, we knew that CURR was the metric we had to move in order to get that strategic breakthrough we wanted. We decided to create a new team, the Retention Team, with CURR as its North Star metric.One of the biggest benefits of focusing on CURR was deciding not to work on things that seemed paramount before, especially new-user retention. This was a huge mindset shift for a company that had tremendous success spending years running the bulk of its growth experiments on new users first.¬†Another big lesson was seeing the massive gap between how a metric could impact DAU vs. MAU; for example, CURR‚Äôs impact on DAU was 6 times its impact on MAU. iWAURR (inactive WAU reactivation rate) was the second-best lever for moving DAU but a distant fourth for moving MAU, behind increasing new and resurrected users. This meant that, at some point, we would still need to figure out new growth vectors for new-user acquisition if we wanted to see substantial MAU improvements. But for the time being, our focus was only on moving DAU, so we prioritized CURR over all other growth levers. And it turned out to be the right choice.¬†¬†Leaderboards vectorWith this clear directive, we looked at our historical model data and at our A/B tests going back a few years to see if we had inadvertently done anything that had moved CURR in the past. Surprisingly, we hadn‚Äôt. In fact, CURR had not moved in years. We had to figure out our first steps to move CURR based on first principles.¬†I still thought gamification was a good place to start when trying to improve retention. Our failure with the Gardenscapes-style moves counter hadn‚Äôt actually disproved any of the original reasons why we believed gamification still had upside for Duolingo‚Äîwe had only learned that the moves counter was a clumsy attempt at it. This time, we would be more methodical and intelligent about features we added or borrowed. We made sure to apply the lessons from our prior efforts with gamification.After some consideration, we decided to bet on leaderboards. Here‚Äôs why and how. Duolingo already had a leaderboard for users to compete with their friends and family, but it wasn‚Äôt particularly effective. Based on my experience at Zynga, I felt that there was a better way. When I started working on Zynga‚Äôs FarmVille 2 game, it included a leaderboard similar to Duolingo‚Äôs existing leaderboard, where users competed with their friends. I had hypothesized based on my personal experience as a player that the closeness of the competitor‚Äôs engagement would be more important than the closeness of personal relationships. I thought this would be especially true in a mature product where many users‚Äô friends weren‚Äôt active anymore. From our testing at Zynga, that idea turned out to be true. Based on this, I felt a leaderboard system, similar to what I had helped design at Zynga, would succeed in the context of our product.FarmVille 2‚Äôs leaderboard also included a ‚Äúleague‚Äù system. Beyond getting to the top of a weekly leaderboard, users had the opportunity to move through a series of league levels (e.g. from the Bronze league to the Silver league to the Gold league). Leagues provided users with a greater sense of progress and reward, an integral element in game design. They also increased engagement over time, since engaged users move up to more competitive leagues week after week. We felt this feature would translate well to Duolingo‚Äôs existing product because it tapped directly into the common human motivators of competitiveness and progression.¬†Users are matched with other users who had a similar level of engagement in the prior week. The top players at the end of this week move up to a higher league the following week.Not all aspects of the FarmVille 2 leaderboards would translate well to Duolingo, though. We had to use our judgment to adapt this gaming mechanic to Duolingo‚Äôs context. In FarmVille 2, competing in the leaderboard required completing additional kinds of tasks on top of the core gameplay. That was something that we purposefully left out. In the Duolingo context, more tasks would only add unnecessary complexity to language learning. We deliberately made our leaderboard as casual and frictionless as possible; users were automatically opted in and could progress to the top of the first league by merely engaging consistently in their regular language study. By keeping the game mechanic exciting, but making it simpler than in FarmVille 2, we felt like we had struck the right balance of adopting and adapting.The leaderboards feature had a huge and almost immediate impact on our metrics. Overall learning time increased by 17%, and the number of highly engaged learners (users who spend at least 1 hour a day for 5 days a week) tripled. At this time, we hadn‚Äôt yet figured out how to calculate statistical significance for CURR, but we saw that our traditional retention metrics (D1, D7, etc.) improved materially and with statistical significance. Going forward, the leaderboards feature became a vector for improving metrics, and teams continue to optimize the feature to this day. Also importantly, the leaderboard was the Retention Team‚Äôs first breakthrough!¬†Push notifications vectorThe Retention Team was completely energized to find more mechanics to keep current users engaged and motivated to practice every day. One area they started to look into was push notifications. Based on substantial A/B testing in prior years, Duolingo had established that notifications can be a big vector for growth, but that impact had plateaued for us over the years. With a re-energized team full of new ideas, we felt it was the right time to revisit this vector.As we started diving into this, there was one principle that became paramount. It came from a cautionary tale from Groupon‚Äôs CEO. He explained to Luis von Ahn, our CEO, that for a long time, Groupon stuck to one email notification per day. But their team started wondering whether sending more emails would improve metrics. The CEO eventually gave in and allowed his team to test sending one more email to each user each day. This test resulted in a big increase to their target metrics. Encouraged, Groupon kept experimenting, sending more emails, even as many as five a day. Then, in what felt like a change from one day to the next, their email channel lost most of its effectiveness. Over time, the accumulation of Groupon‚Äôs aggressive email tests had basically destroyed their channel. One often underappreciated risk with aggressively A/B testing emails and push notifications is that it results in users opting out of the channel; and even if you kill the test, those users remain opted out forever. Do this many times, and you‚Äôve destroyed your channel. This was the outcome to avoid. For our push notifications, we established one foundational rule: protect the channel.With this constraint in mind, we decided to give the team a lot of freedom to optimize on dimensions like timing, templates, images, copy, localization, etc., but they could not increase the quantity of notifications without strong justification and CEO approval. Over time, through countless iterations, A/B testing, and a bandit algorithm, the team was able to generate dozens of small- and medium-size wins that have amounted to substantial gains in DAU year after year.¬†A meme about Duolingo‚Äôs ‚Äúpushiness‚Äù that went viral in 2019The streak vectorIn the search for even more growth vectors, the APM on the Retention Team started exploring whether there was a strong correlation between retention and usage of particular Duolingo features. He discovered that if a user reached a 10-day streak, their chances of dropping off were reduced substantially. Clearly, a lot of this was simply correlation and selection bias, but we felt the insight was interesting enough to start investing in improving this feature again.¬†The concept of a streak is really quite simple: show users the number of consecutive days they‚Äôve done any activity on the app. But it turns out that there is a surprisingly large number of optimization opportunities around streaks.¬†We got our first big win with the streak-saver notification‚Äîa notification that alerts users with streaks if they are about to lose their streak. This late-night notification proved that indeed there was considerable upside to doubling down on streak optimizations. After this, several improvements followed: calendar views, animations, changes to streak freezes, and streak rewards, among others. Each helped improve upon the original streak idea and generated substantial improvements to retention.¬†To date, the streak feature is one of Duolingo‚Äôs most powerful engagement mechanics. When people talk about their Duolingo experience, they often bring up their streak. I recently met one user who told me, ‚ÄúI have a 1,435-day streak!‚Äù and added, ‚Äúwith no streak freezes!‚Äù His bragging rights were well-earned, as he had been studying his chosen language daily for almost four years.Streaks work for a number of reasons. One of those is that a streak increases user motivation over time; the longer the streak is, the greater the impetus to keep the streak going. When it comes to user retention, this is the exact behavior we want in our users. Each day that a learner comes to Duolingo, they care a bit more about coming back the next day than they did the day before, hence increasing retention and DAU. As a meta-lesson, our success with the streak mechanic further showed us that we could squeeze major wins from existing features. We could see the value in both big breakthroughs and in fast optimizations. And an A+ team often has a mix of both.Growth beyond CURRWe didn‚Äôt stop at CURR; there was a very healthy paranoia that at some point CURR would hit a ceiling, so sooner or later we would have to figure out growth vectors for new user acquisition. The Retention Team stayed focused on increasing CURR, but as a company, we consistently increased our investment in growth by creating more and more Product and Marketing teams to find new vectors (for both retention and acquisition). Luckily, several of these bets worked, including expanding internationally, building social features (this is what the Acquisition eventually team pivoted to, with great success), accelerating course content creation, working with influencers, increasing our presence in schools, investing (a little bit) in paid UA, and going crazy viral on TikTok. Each of these merits its own case study.¬†Overall resultsThrough our efforts over four years, we were able to increase CURR by 21%, which represents a reduction in the daily churn of our best users by over 40% and, together with our other successful bets, led to an increase in our DAU of 4.5x. Last year was one of the fastest growth rates in Duolingo‚Äôs history. The quality of the user base also improved; the share of our DAU with a streak of 7 days or longer increased almost 3 times to more than half of our DAU. This means that not only does Duolingo have a much higher number of active users now, but also that those users are much more likely to keep coming back, refer their friends, and subscribe to Super Duolingo. This growth was key to Duolingo‚Äôs successful IPO.¬†Parting thoughtsI hope that this article gives you the inspiration you need to find new vectors of growth for your product. If you adopt anything from my experience at Duolingo, I hope you adapt it to your own context using your best judgment. Don‚Äôt blindly trust what Duolingo or any other company did. Certainly that didn‚Äôt work for me. Happy experimenting!AcknowledgementsGamification Team: You know who you are.

I‚Äôm Lenny, and each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that‚Äôs stressing you out at the office. Send me your questions¬†and in return, I‚Äôll humbly offer actionable real-talk advice. ü§úü§õIf you find this post valuable, check out some of my other posts:How To Know If You've Got Product/Market FitHow to Kickstart and Scale a Marketplace BusinessHow To Get Into Product Management (And Thrive)To receive this newsletter in your inbox weekly, consider subscribing üëáSubscribeQ: How did the big consumer apps get their first 1,000 users?Considering every startup confronts this question at some point, I was surprised by how little has been written about it. Particularly anything actionable. So I decided to do my own digging. I spent the past month personally reaching out to founders, scouring interviews, and tapping the Twitterverse. Below, you‚Äôll find first-hand accounts of how essentially every major consumer app acquired their earliest users, including lessons from Tinder, Uber, Superhuman, TikTok, Product Hunt, Netflix, and many more. Enjoy!My biggest takeaways from this research:Just seven strategies account for every consumer apps‚Äô early growth.Most startups found their early users from just a single strategy. A few like Product Hunt and Pinterest found success using a handful. No one found success from more than three.The most popular strategies involve going to your user directly ‚Äî online, offline, and through friends. Doing things that don‚Äôt scale.To execute on any of these strategies, it‚Äôs important to first narrowly define your target user. Andy Johns recently shared some great advice about this.The tactics that you use to get your first 1,000 users are very different from your next 10,000. A topic for a different post.If you have any additional insights, stories, or feedback to share, don‚Äôt hesitate to DM me. Otherwise, let‚Äôs dive into the strategies.1. Go where your target users are, offlineKey question: Who are your early target users, and where they currently congregating offline?College campuses ‚Äî Tinder and DoorDashWhitney Wolfe and Justin Mateen would basically run around USC pitching Tinder to sororities and fraternities. The hook of seeing other single people on campus for the first time (and knowing if they‚Äôre interested in you) went viral.‚Äî Jeff Morris Jr.The very first iteration of DoorDash was a website called paloaltodelivery.com with PDF'd menus of restaurants in Palo Alto. Tony and the team printed a bunch of flyers charging $6 for delivery and put them all over Stanford University. He and the team first wanted to see if there was demand. That was how it all started. A website with PDF menus and flyers.‚Äî Micah Moreau Startup offices and transit hubs ‚Äî Lyft and Uber We asked everyone on our team to give us their list of contacts at startups and we contacted them to ask their permission to come by with a free Bi-Rite ice cream sundae dropoff for their employees. They basically all said yes, because Bi-Rite is delicious. :) So we arranged a dropoff operation and had teams of staff with insulated bags taking ice cream sundae kits to all of the companies and giving them Lyft credits.‚Äî Emily Castor WarrenThere was a very significant use of street teams early on at Uber. They went to places like the Caltrain station and handed out referral codes. There are stories about how Travis went to Twitter HQ personally and handed out referral codes.‚Äî Andrew ChenMalls ‚Äî SnapchatEvan started showing it to people one on one, giving tutorials, explaining why it was fun, even downloading the app for them. [‚Ä¶]Evan was willing to try anything to get users. When he was home in Pacific Palisades, he would go to the shopping mall and hand out flyers advertising Snapchat. ‚ÄúI would walk up to people and say, ‚ÄòHey would you like to send a disappearing picture?‚Äô and they would say, ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô‚Äù Evan later recalled. ‚Äî How to Turn Down a Billion Dollars, The Snapchat Story by Billy GallagherNeighborhood HOAs ‚Äî NextdoorBack then, the founding team knew that it would only work if they could find a neighborhood to embrace the idea of a social network for neighborhoods, as well as test it along the way. Choosing the right neighborhood was essential.That neighborhood is known as Lorelei. Nestled close to the Bay on streets shaded by trees, the neighborhood was close-knit and small yet vibrant, with the longest-standing homeowner‚Äôs association in the state of California. The community already had some ways to communicate with each other, which was a promising sign. We reached out to board members of the homeowners association, and they were more than willing to hear us out. After an initial conversation, they invited us to present the concept to more residents at their next board meeting.‚Äî Sarah LearyCraft fairs ‚Äî EtsyEtsy decided to actually go into all these fairs across the United States, having people travel to all these craft fairs and recruit sellers because the sellers would eventually recruit their own buyers to the website instead of just using digital marketing.‚Äî Thales TeixeiraApple stores ‚Äî Pinterest We did all kinds of pretty desperate things, honestly. I used to walk by the Apple store on the way home. I‚Äôd go in and change all the computers to say Pinterest. Then just kind of stand in the back and be like, ‚ÄúWow, this Pinterest thing, it‚Äôs really blowing up.‚Äù‚Äî Ben Silbermann(Note: This strategy will obviously be less effective while we shelter-in-place üò∑) 2. Go where your target users are, onlineKey question: Who are your early target users, and where they currently congregating online?Hacker News ‚Äî Dropbox Drew created a simple video, demoing the product, and published it on April 2007 on Hacker News with the title "My YC app: Dropbox ‚Äì Throw away your USB drive. That video brought the first users to the emerging Dropbox.‚Äî John PopelApp Store ‚Äî TikTok/Musical.lyThere was a secret in the app store. You could make the application name really really long. And the search engine on the App Store gives more weight to the application name rather than the keybookwords defined. So we put a really long application name, "make awesome music videos with all kinds of effects for Instagram, Facebook, Messenger‚Äù. And then traffic came from the search engine. That's how we initially got started.‚Äî Alex ZhuProductHunt ‚Äî LoomFirst ~3k came in from Product Hunt on launch day + 1-2 days after. 3k-20k: Came from early champions at organizations (we tried to build 1:1 relationships with all of them).21k+: we introduced our referral system ($5 in credits for every coworker you refer up to $50)‚Äî Shahed KhanPiggy-back off of an existing online community ‚Äî Netflix and BufferTo help us connect further with customers, we brought in Corey Bridges to work on customer acquisition ‚Äì or, more specifically, on something we jokingly called Black ops. A one-time English major at Berkely, he was a brilliant writer with a gift for creating characters. He'd realized, early on, that the only way to find DVD owners was in the fringe communities of the internet: user groups, bulletin boards, web forums, and all of the other digital watering holes where enthusiasts met up. Corey's plan was to infiltrate these communities. He wouldn't announce himself as a Netflix employee. Posing as a home theater enthusiast or cinephile, he would join the conversation in communities geared toward DVD fanatics and movie buffs, befriend the major players, and slowly, over time, alert the most respected commenters, moderators, and website owners about this great new site called Netflix. We were months from launch, but he was planting seeds that would pay off...big time.‚Äî That Will Never Work by Marc Randolph (Netflix)Solely through guest blogging we‚Äôve acquired around 100,000 users within the first 9 months of running Buffer. Here is more on this number, a bit before we hit the 100,000. It‚Äôs been something that was very gradual though. Within the space of around 9 months, I wrote around 150 guest posts. Of course the early ones barely drove any traffic and only very gradually did things improve, I think that‚Äôs very important to understand. It will take a while until you can find the right frequency of posting. ‚Äî Leo Widrich (Buffer)3. Invite your friendsKey question: Do your friends fit into the target user group? If so, have you invited them yet?YelpInviting people from our network (mostly former coworkers from PayPal) drove our initial users. We asked all our network to invite their friends, and being startup people who wanted to help us, they obliged, so two-degrees out we probably got to 1k or so users. The takeaway is not to underestimate the power of one's personal referral network and to think deeply about the incentive and mechanics.‚Äî Russel SimmonsLyftBefore the waitlists came personal email invites to our friends, like the one above.‚Äî Emily Castor WarrenFacebookThefacebook.com went up on Wednesday, February 4, 2004. ‚ÄúIt was a normal night in the dorm,‚Äù Moskovitz recalled. ‚ÄúWhen Mark finished the site, we told a couple of friends. And then one of them suggested putting it on the Kirkland House online mailing list, which was, like, three hundred people. And, once they did that, several dozen people joined, and then they were telling people at the other houses. By the end of the night, we were, like, actively watching the registration process. Within twenty-four hours, we had somewhere between twelve hundred and fifteen hundred registrants.‚Äù‚Äî New YorkerQuoraQuora launched in January 2010 with a user base largely composed of D'Angelo's and Cheever's college and high-school friends, meaning there was a lot of early Quora information on the best places to eat in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Cheever was raised. But they also built a feature into the site whereby users could invite people, and soon their friends from Facebook were summoning people from other startups, and other entrepreneurs.‚Äî WiredLinkedInReid intentionally seeded the product with successful friends and connections recognizing that cultivating an aspirational brand was crucial to drive mainstream adoption. (The entire company would have been doomed if there had been massive adoption of have-nots, instead of people who were hiring, recruiting etc.)‚Äî Keith RaboisSlackWe begged and cajoled our friends at other companies to try it out and give us feedback. We had maybe six to ten companies to start with that we found this way.The pattern was to share Slack with progressively larger groups. We amplified the feedback we got at each stage by adding more teams.‚Äî Stewart ButterfieldPinterestSo we released the app and I did probably what everyone does‚Äìemailed all my friends and kind of hoped that it would to take off. And no one really got it, to be totally honest with you. [‚Ä¶] But there was a small group of people that were enjoying it. And those folks were not who I think stereotypically you think of when you think about early adopters. They were folks that I grew up with, people that were using it for regular stuff in their life. You know, ‚ÄúWhat is my house going to look like? What kind of food do I want to eat?‚Äù Things like that. ‚Äî Ben SilbermannSubscribe4. Create FOMO in order to drive word-of-mouthKey questions: Does your product rely on UGC? Consider curating the early community.Is your value-prop incredibly strong? Consider throwing up a waitlist.Is your product innately social? Consider relying on existing users to invite new users.Make it exclusive by curating the early community ‚Äî Instagram, Pinterest, and Clubhouse It‚Äôs been interesting to watch Clubhouse do this via private Testflight:Curation (keeping quality high)Exclusivity (creates FOMO)Quick iteration (no App Store review process)High-quality referrals from initial seed users‚Äî Todd GoldbergI think the biggest thing overall was that as we were prototyping and testing [Instagram]¬†we gave it to a few folks who had very large Twitter following. Not necessarily a large following overall, but very large followings within a specific community ‚Äî specifically, the designer community, the online web design community. We felt that photography and the visual element of what we were doing really resonated with those people. And we gave it to those specific people who a large followings.And because they shared to Twitter, it created this tension, of like ‚ÄúWhen is this thing launching, when‚Äôd do I get to play with it?‚Äù and that‚Äôs the day when we actually launched, it had that springboard affect.‚Äî Kevin Systrom (Instagram)Pinterest started as an invite-only community. The first users were design bloggers Silbermann recruited. He advised these invitees to only extend admission to people they knew with unique ideas and creative minds. The exclusive community grew slowly until 2012 when the site removed the invitation requirement.‚Äî EntreprenuerAdd a waitlist - Mailbox, Robinhood, Clubhouse, Superhuman, and PinterestMailbox, the email inbox management app for iPhone that was released in beta this week, currently has around 700,000 users queuing up for access, at the time of this writing [‚Ä¶] It‚Äôs ostensibly a mechanism to help Mailbox‚Äôs servers manage the tremendous demand put upon them by users, though some believe it‚Äôs a marketing ploy designed to increase demand.‚Äî Darrell EtheringtonIn the first year of Superhuman, as we were primarily building, we threw up a landing page. It was a terrible landing page, a basic Squarespace thing, that took us all of 2 hours to put together. All you could do on this page was throw in your email address. And when you threw in your email address, you got an automatic email from me, with two questions:What do you use for email today?What were your pet peeves about it?‚Äî Rahul VohraThe last thing from our minds when we launched Robinhood, the initial website, was that it would blow up overnight, so we were kind of cavalier in the way we approached it. [The website] had a description in very simple language saying, "Commission-free trading, stop paying up to $10 per trade." And then there was a button that let you sign up, and then when you signed up, you put in your email, and you would join this wait list where we would actually show you: There's this many people ahead of you, this many people behind you. [‚Ä¶]I remember distinctly it was a Friday night. We had been working on the wait list in preparation for our press launch, which would have been, I think, the following Wednesday or Thursday. Everyone goes home, and I wake up Saturday morning, and I open up Google Analytics, and I see something like 600 concurrents on our site, which nobody knew about at that point. I was just like, "What's going on? This is not normal. Something must be wrong." Right?And I'm looking at the analytics ‚Äî I see a lot of traffic, or the majority of it, coming from Hacker News. And I open up Hacker News, and I see No. 1: "Chinese Land Spaceship on the Moon," No. 2: "Google acquires Boston Dynamics, the Robotics Company," and No. 3 was: "Robinhood: Free Stock Trading." So, first of all, I was like, "Oh man, like No. 3 on Hacker News? This is sort of like every engineer's dream in the Valley, right? ‚Äî Business InsiderNew users must be invited by existing users - SpotifyThe music streaming service went live in October 2008, and it kept its free service invitation only, something that had been in place whilst it was in the final stages of development prior to public launch.The invitation-only element was a vital part of the platform‚Äôs rise. Not only did it help manage the growth level of Spotify, but it also helped create a viral element to the service, with users each having 5 invites at first to share with their friends.‚Äî TNW5. Leverage influencersKey question: Who are influencers of your target users, and how could you get them to talk about your product?TwitterThis is the day-by-day chart for the initial launch. The first public mention of the service I can find is¬†on Evan William's blog late on July 13th, but you can see that even on the 12th there was a mini-boom in registrations. Then¬†Om Malik's post on the 15th really pushed it over the top, with more than 250 people signing up the next day. What I find fascinating is that there were less than 600 people on the service at that point, so it was a very prescient plug. [‚Ä¶]A recurring theme is the power of that initial publicity in driving the early users, and the feeling that it was a way to connect with an interesting group of people. Evan's high-profile and Om's endorsement must have been a big help in building that sort of buzz.‚Äî Pete WardenProduct HuntOnce we identified an influencer, Nathan or myself sent a personal email, inviting them to contribute and linking to the PandoDaily or Fast Company articles, to tell our story. A manual process indeed, but an effective way to recruit good contributors and open lines of communication for future feedback. ‚Äî Ryan HooverInstagramThe founders picked their first users carefully, courting people who would be good photographers‚Äîespecially designers who had high Twitter follower counts. Those first users would help set the right artistic tone, creating good content for everyone else to look at, in what was essentially the first-ever Instagram influencer campaign, years before that would become a concept. Dorsey became their best salesman. He was initially shocked to find out his investment money was going toward an entirely different app than Burbn. Usually, founders pivoted to a new product as a last-ditch effort to avoid going out of business. But Dorsey loved Instagram, way more than he‚Äôd ever loved Burbn.When Instagram launched to the public on October 6, 2010, it immediately went viral thanks to shares from people like Dorsey. It reached number one in camera applications in the Apple app store.‚Äî No Filter: The Inside Story of Instagram, by Sarah Frier6. Get pressKey question: What‚Äôs a unique, compelling, fresh story you could pitch press?SuperhumanThe best way to do it is to pick one or two events a year where you can insert yourself into the cultural zeitgeist. For us, one such event was when Mailbox was being shut down. It was the perfect narrative, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm over here, come look at my company.‚Äù [‚Ä¶] I currently have one of the most widely read articles on how to survive an acquisition. It was written in response to the Mailbox shutdown. [‚Ä¶] That post ended up on Medium, and was syndicated to qz.com. We were able to insert it into the Zeitgeist. That article probably took me three days of doing nothing else, and another day of shopping it around. So four days all in. But those four days bought north of 5,000 signups.‚Äî Rahul VohraProduct HuntI wrote guest posts on tech publications (like this article on FastCo) to drive awareness. In the early days, press was effective in driving adoption. The same people that read tech publications like TechCrunch are the same people that might want to visit Product Hunt. Additionally, we forwarded compelling products that launched on Product Hunt to reporters that I knew. I made sure to send products that were relevant to their interests or beat, resulting in several articles mentioning and linking back to Product Hunt. Bonus points: We were helping makers and early stage startups get more visibility‚Äî Ryan HooverAirbnbThe event that marked the turning point in the business was the 2008 Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Denver, Colorado. The pair saw an opportunity to capitalize on the quadruple over-attended event that caused a massive shortage in rental housing. Finding hosts to offer up rooms in their houses was actually the easy part. Getting people to rent those rooms proved more difficult.The first counterintuitive strategy was to pitch only the bloggers with the smallest audience possible. [‚Ä¶] As ridiculous as it sounds, the coverage by these bottom-feeder press was the social proof that more prominent publications needed to piggyback on the story. Eventually, national news networks, including NBC and CBS, were interviewing the founders of the unknown startup that was housing the biggest political convention in history.The DNC bump was great for business, but it only lasted a week. The founders were desperate for a way to extend the impact of the event. While sitting around their kitchen table one day, still extremely broke, they came up with the idea that would bring Airbnb to profitability: cereal.Both designers who graduated from the prestigious Rhode Island School of Design, the pair created fictitious cereals called ‚ÄúObama O's, the Cereal of Change,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCap‚Äôn McCain's, a Maverick in Every Box.‚Äù They designed the box artwork themselves and convinced a student at UC Berkeley to print 500 units of each box on the cheap. The boxes were delivered as flat rectangles that had to be cut and assembled by hand.‚ÄúI was thinking at the time, that Mark Zuckerberg was never hot gluing anything at Facebook ‚Äì so maybe this is not a good idea,‚Äù recalls Chesky.The founders sent boxes to hundreds of the most well-known tech bloggers, hoping that they would proudly display them on their desks and that they, or their colleagues, would eventually write their story. Shortly thereafter, they started selling the political cereal at $40 per box. The Obama O's sold like hot cakes, so much so that they had to give out Cap‚Äôn McCain's for free with each purchase. ‚Äî PandoSlackThat was essentially our beta release, but we didn't want to call it a beta because then people would think that the service would be flaky or unreliable,‚Äù Butterfield says. Instead, with help from an impressive press blitz (based largely on the team's prior experience ‚Äî i.e. use whatever you've got going for you), they welcomed people to request an invitation to try Slack. On the first day, 8,000 people did just that; and two weeks later, that number had grown to 15,000.The big lesson here: Don't underestimate the power of traditional media when you launch.‚Äî Stewart ButterfieldInstagramThey also contacted the press directly rather than using a PR firm, and Kevin notes that this went down very well. A good product, pitched by the passionate creators themselves, and as it happens they secured a load of good coverage for launch. ‚ÄúWe were shameless about contacting people who we thought would love the product‚Äù, says Kevin. ‚ÄúBut it paid off. People actually said to us there‚Äôs no point contacting publications such as The New York Times and that we‚Äôd be wasting our time. But not only did¬†The New York Times¬†speak to us, they also sent someone to meet with us‚Äù. On the day of launch in October 2010, all the press coverage happened at roughly the same time and their servers were hit hard.‚Äî TNW7. Build a community pre-launchKey question: Could you build a community now, to leverage later?Product HuntProduct Hunt, a daily leaderboard of new products, began as an email list using Linkydink, a tool for creating collaborative daily email digests. [‚Ä¶]Over Thanksgiving break, we designed and built Product Hunt. Meanwhile, we reached out to contributors in the MVP and other respected product people, sharing early mocks and gathering feedback. We weren‚Äôt just doing customer development, we were getting them excited and making them feel like part of the product (and they were, helping guide our design decisions).5 days later, we had a very minimal but fully functional product. We emailed our supporters a link to Product Hunt, informing them not to share it publicly. The supporters were thrilled to join and play with a working version of something they had thought about and indirectly, helped build. That day we acquired our first 30 users. [‚Ä¶] By the end of the week, we had 100 users and felt ready to share Product Hunt with the world.‚Äî Ryan HooverStackOverflowThe founders of Stack Overflow (Joel Spolsky & Jeff Atwood) both had large communities of existing followers from their previous online endeavors (Joel On Software and Coding Horror respectively). They invited members of those communities to participate in a private beta, in which they seeded the site with content so it didn't launch with no content whatsoever.‚Äî JonIn summaryTop seven strategies to acquire your first 1,000 usersGo where your target users are, offlineGo where your target users are, onlineInvite your friendsCreate FOMO in order to drive word-of-mouthLeverage influencersGet pressBuild a community pre-launchKey questions to ask yourself to determine where to focus:Who are your early target users, and where they currently congregating, offline?Who are your early target users, and where they currently congregating, online?Do your friends fit into the target user group?

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, here‚Äôs what you missed this month:My favorite decision-making frameworksWhy you should add a work trial to your interview processThe ultimate guide to willingness-to-paySubscribeP.S. Don‚Äôt miss Lennybot (an AI chatbot trained on my newsletter posts, podcast interviews, and more), my PM recruiting service (helping you hire Sr. PMs and VPs), my Swag store (great gifts for your favorite PM, or yourself!), and The Best of Lenny‚Äôs Newsletter book (all proceeds going to charity).It‚Äôs become clear to me that everyone should be playing with GPTs (custom versions of ChatGPT) right now. It‚Äôs easy to think AI tools are a fad, too complicated, or unlikely to have real impact on your job. But you‚Äôre wrong. Consider these recent news items that caught my attention:PwC forecasts that AI could contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 from increased productivity.When Italy banned ChatGPT, the productivity of coders in the country fell by 50% before recovering. On the flip side, Duolingo reported a 25% increase in developer velocity when using GitHub Copilot, and Shopify has already written over a million lines of code with Copilot.Nat Friedman (former CEO of GitHub) and Daniel Gross (former Y Combinator partner) are investing $100 million in a startup called Magic that‚Äôs looking to replace engineers. Prominent engineers are worried.In the public markets, there‚Äôs a growing separation between companies betting heavily on AI and those that aren‚Äôt.The power of AI models is only accelerating. Even MrBeast is worried. Here‚Äôs AI video generation 10 months ago vs. today. Here‚Äôs a video generated by Sora (OpenAI‚Äôs latest model) from the prompt ‚ÄúTwo golden retrievers podcasting on top of a mountain.‚Äù üòÆ As Chris Dixon put it, ‚ÄúThe next big thing will start out looking like a toy.‚ÄùI started to get super-curious in particular about leveraging GPTs at work after my recent podcast conversation with Logan Kilpatrick (head of developer relations at OpenAI). He shared a few examples of how people at top-tier tech companies are using custom GPTs to help their non-eng teams be more productive, while also taking a load off their eng teams. I wanted to find more examples‚Äîto see how and why people are doing this‚Äîso I turned to Twitter and LinkedIn. I asked how people are using GPTs in their day-to-day work now. The volume (and variety) of responses blew my mind. I got over 300 replies with hundreds of examples‚Äîfrom cooking up copy experiments to extracting feature ideas from sales calls to having conversations with their customer personas. The creativity, and the impact people are seeing, is ü§Ø.Below, to help you explore this yourself, I‚Äôll explain what GPTs are and help you build your own custom GPT. Then I‚Äôll share 20 examples of how people are using GPTs today to make their workplaces more productive. When you read this post, I encourage you to pick an idea and try to create your own GPT. See how easy it is, and how good they actually are. You may be blown away too.A big thank-you to Dan Shipper and Dennis Yang for providing feedback on this post, and to everyone X and LinkedIn who shared their experience.What are GPTs?GPTs are custom versions of ChatGPT that can be tailored for very specific tasks. They live at a unique URL, run in the cloud, and anyone can make one in a few minutes.To set one up, you tell the GPT what you want it to do for you (in plain English), upload docs that ‚Äútrain‚Äù it on your specific context (e.g. your roadmap), and then adjust the capabilities it can leverage to complete your task (e.g. browse the web, use Zapier to take actions, etc.).Normally, straight-up ChatGPT is more than enough for most use cases, but if you want to upload proprietary datasets or customize how the chatbot interacts, and then share this tailor-made GPT with colleagues, custom GPTs are the way to go.How to create your own GPTIt‚Äôs so easy. Go here, sign up, click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù in the top right corner, and tell the AI what you want it to do. Here‚Äôs one I created in a few minutes that helps you think more strategically based on advice from the writings of Hamilton Helmer, Michael Porter, Annie Duke, Richard Rumelt, and Geoffrey Moore.Strategy SageOnce you get the initial version set up, you can then upload ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù‚Äîdecks, PDFs, spreadsheets, and any other documents that give the GPT more information on your specific context and company. For example, you can upload your roadmap, your company values, your career ladders, etc. The more you give it, the better it does. Think of it like onboarding a person‚Äîwhat context would you want them to have to do their job well?To delve deeper into GPTs:Read this very short guide from OpenAI on how to create a GPTBrowse examples of the most popular public GPTsGet a ChatGPT Plus account.

And if you‚Äôve found another use case for GPTs at your workplace, I‚Äôd love to know. Just leave a comment below.1. Refine new product copy‚ÄúWe built a UX GPT Writer trained on all of our writing, brand guidelines, and product nomenclature. Designers rough out what they need it to say, send the GPT a screenshot from Figma, and it will rewrite it to be concise, using our guideline and brand voice standard. This means anyone on our team can write well, whether they‚Äôre a product manager, designer, or engineer.‚Äù‚ÄîDiego Zaks, VP of design at Ramp2. Have conversations with your personas‚ÄúEveryone has ‚Äòpersonas.‚Äô I literally took our persona documents, made it a PDF, uploaded it to the GPT (as knowledge), and made a GPT to talk to our personas. It helps me refine roadmap ideas and really empathize better with my customers.‚Äù‚ÄîDennis Yang, PM at Chime3. Learn from past user research findings‚ÄúWe built a GPT that indexes all of our user research decks, and then people can ask questions [about past research findings]. It‚Äôll answer the questions and link to the decks.‚Äù ‚ÄîAnonymous4. Create a source of truth for product requirements‚ÄúWe created a custom GPT that has our DB schema, company overview, and some of our product requirements in markdown format. We are in the middle of an intense push over the next six weeks to deliver a fairly substantial feature set. This custom GPT is fully armed to act as both a source of truth for requirements and brainstorming technical approaches.If you are a PM and want to take [your work] to the next level, look at delivering not just the usual PRD, but also an internally shareable link to a custom GPT that has those same requirements added to its context. (Don‚Äôt forget to disable the training toggle in setup.) Your devs will love you.‚Äù‚ÄîMatt Burch, VP of engineering at Making Space5. Figure out internal ownership and technical dependencies‚ÄúWe have a GPT that searches the internal employee databases and org structures and component libraries, and answers queries like ‚ÄòWho is the eng lead for X‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is the Jira component for Y?‚Äô etc.‚Äù ‚ÄîAnonymous6. Dream up copy experiment ideas ‚ÄúI use this for experiment analysis and copy:Train a custom GPT on brand guidelines and examples.[I feed] Google Sheets ‚Üí Zapier ‚Üí GPT connection. When I enter in my control copy, GPT will create two variants, explaining the hypothesis for each.GPT ‚Üí Zapier ‚Üí Google Sheets connection. When I enter in experiment results, GPT will hypothesize why X variant won.Upload a CSV of all experiment results to custom GPT again, so GPT can learn from winning experiments.Challenges: When analysing experiment results, it lacks context on the product and other external factors, but I can‚Äôt feed that to the GPT out of data privacy issues.‚Äù ‚ÄîQuintin Au, growth marketing manager at Spotify7. Create a personal exec coach for yourself‚ÄúI‚Äôve made a CEO coach GPT that I‚Äôve trained on podcasts and books from my fav business leaders so I can ask it questions and advice. Works well!‚Äù‚ÄîAlex Zaccaria, CEO of Linktree8. Help your team set annual goals‚ÄúI built a custom GPT to assist my team with setting their annual goals. It used to be a real struggle to get people to do it, and when they did, it often took hours and multiple meetings to refine.I took the company values, team principles and values, company scorecards, and our progression model and used that as a knowledge base. I then had my team share where they wanted to be in five years, what they are currently interested in, and what their current role in the company is. The GPT then returns custom, detailed goals using the SMART framework that takes all the values above into consideration. It gives people their annual goal and then it shares quarterly goals based on the annual ones. They now have goals that are unique to them and their career aspirations while still aligning with what the expectations are at a company level. I‚Äôve been told countless times how much they love the workflow and how much easier it is to set goals. I‚Äôve got people adding goals on time for the first time in seven years without having to track them down.‚Äù ‚ÄîAndrew Kelly, Designer9. Grade the relevance of search results‚ÄúAt Faire we use GPT to grade the relevance of our search results. For reporting, we used to have a manual operation grading the relevance of search. Now automated through GPT. For model offline evaluations, we used to manually look at examples, now automated through GPT.[In terms of impact on reporting], it‚Äôs much cheaper to label with GPT vs. humans. [On model evaluation], an increased experiment win rate. We have a better idea of what our models are actually doing to relevance before launch and a better sense of what works vs. not.‚Äù‚ÄîMinh Pham, PM at Faire10. Create data pipeline documentation‚Äú[I] created a tool for my data engineers which almost completely off-loaded the work they absolutely hated to do (and thus saved for last/never): documentation. Before, documentation of our data pipeline was horribly incomplete and would quickly grow stale. Even though it isn‚Äôt perfect, the tool saved so much time that adoption by the team was assured.‚Äù‚ÄîJason B. Hart, director of global analytics and data operations at Springboard11. Generate takeaways from raw survey results‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a custom GPT to analyze survey responses from the prior week/month/quarter to create a report for the team each week.‚Äù‚ÄîAdrianne Stone, PM at Big Cartel12. Generate takeaways from sales conversations‚ÄúFor me, GPT revolutionizes sales. Our most impactful application of GPT lies in summarizing customer interviews in sales. We used to spend a ton of time conducting interviews and synthesizing findings to improve our sales process, find innovative feature ideas for R&D, and enhance marketing collateral. It‚Äôs all history now.With GPT, we:‚Ü≥ Identify recurring pain points across all interviews.‚Ü≥ Find compelling customer testimonials for marketing materials.‚Ü≥ Pinpoint nuanced critique points that we may have missed.‚Ü≥ Generate action items for every individual customer interaction to hand over to CSM/AE.The benefits to our customer experience (CX) efforts are gigantic.‚Äù‚ÄîAdam Egger, co-founder of SKLLD13. Score customer leads‚ÄúWe created a chatbot to nurture/score potential customers. This way we would only process the ones that would be more likely to become customers.‚Äù ‚ÄîJavier Ortiz, head of marketing/growth at Taxfix14. Avoid vendor customer support‚ÄúWhen a team is frequently working with a vendor with complicated support (e.g. they don‚Äôt have a chatbot, long wait times, etc.), we make a GPT for that vendor. We upload all of the vendor documentation and API docs and point it to the website and support docs, etc. Now when the team has a support question, they first ask the GPT the question. We find they often get faster, better answers than from the vendor itself.‚Äù‚ÄîDennis Yang, PM at Chime15.

How to use ChatGPT in your PM work - by Lenny Rachitsky

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeAre PMs actually using ChatGPT/GPT-4 for getting real work done, and if so, how?Let this idea sink in:Siqi Chen @bladerproduct development is basically just prompt engineering the engineers to rotate words into the right shapes.

soon it‚Äôll be prompt engineering all the way down.8:44 AM ‚àô Mar 15, 202399Likes8RetweetsThough I don‚Äôt believe PMs will be displaced by GPT-4/5/6/n, I do believe that, as with most knowledge work, learning to work alongside AI will quickly become table stakes. Just like Grammarly became for writing, Copilot for engineers, and Firefly, Runway, Midjourney, and others are becoming for designers. It‚Äôs scary and confusing, but also exciting. When was the last time there was a transformative new tool for product management? Never?Shreyas Doshi @shreyasThe year is 2027.

GPT-7 does most of the work on product teams: mocks, code, research, data analysis. There are highly leveraged engineers, designers, analysts working across 5-10 products. Every product still has a PM, who has 55 GPT tabs open.

PM now means Prompt Manager üòÅ deepu @pradeepb28I wonder if @lennysan @shreyas have thoughts or predictions about what the product management would look like in next 5 years ?11:23 AM ‚àô Dec 27, 2022369Likes35RetweetsImportantly, as Dan Shipper suggested in his recent guest post on building the Lenny Chatbot, ‚Äúthe best way to prepare for this fast-approaching future is to dive in and get your hands dirty.‚Äù So to help you roll up your sleeves and get started, I polled Twitter for concrete examples of how PMs are already using ChatGPT day-to-day. Honestly, I was shocked by how common (and useful) it has already become for people. Below, I‚Äôve collected a dozen of my favorite use cases of how you can integrate ChatGPT into your work today‚Äîwith actual prompts you can play with.To follow along, go sign up for ChatGPT (seriously, go do that now), and try at least one prompt you find below. Even if you don‚Äôt find it useful today, it‚Äôll plant a seed.Also, a pro tip: You can ask ChatGPT for advice on how to best phrase your prompt. It‚Äôs very meta and very cool. For example:Barada Sahu @mercurialsolo@lennysan @laurynisford P1: "Imagine you are a Product manager making a prompt to improve the onboarding for Airtable. Please write the prompt" 

Fed the prompt and came up with ideas

_________
I want to scrape App Store reviews of our app using Javascript. Walk me through it step by step.

Then, I pasted all the reviews into the chat and asked GPT-4 to find the top 3 most requested features and complaints.4:54 PM ‚àô Mar 27, 2023Extract insights from raw usage metrics:RossMcLoughlin @Dotnetster@lennysan Converting our product usage metrics data to text and then just asking GPT questions about the data.6:22 PM ‚àô Mar 27, 20231Like1RetweetDo sensitivity analysis:Mark Rogers @tlonuqbar@lennysan You can paste in the data in a table and ask for the conversion percentages.

The 10 commandments of salary negotiation

























Lenny's NewsletterSubscribeSign inShare this postThe 10 commandments of salary negotiationwww.lennysnewsletter.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOtherThe 10 commandments of salary negotiationGuest post by Niya Dragova, co-founder of CandorLenny RachitskySep 24, 2021158Share this postThe 10 commandments of salary negotiationwww.lennysnewsletter.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOther53Shareüëã Hey,¬†Lenny¬†here!¬†Welcome to a ‚ú® bonus edition¬†‚ú® of my weekly newsletter. Each week I humbly tackle reader questions about product, growth, working with humans, and anything else that‚Äôs stressing you out about work.If you‚Äôre not a paid subscriber, here‚Äôs what you missed this month:GTM motions of 30 B2B SaaS companiesGetting more technicalExamples and templates of 1-Pagers and PRDsSubscribeOn to this week‚Äôs post‚Ä¶Q: I‚Äôm about to start interviewing for a new job, and I‚Äôm really bad at negotiating. I know I should, but I basically never negotiate my comp. How do I learn to negotiate, without pissing anyone off?If you think you‚Äôre bad at negotiating, I‚Äôm even worse, I promise you. Why can‚Äôt you just tell me how much it‚Äôll be, and then we can move on? Why do we need to play this game?? Jeez louise.Well, the reason we have to play this game is because, like it or not, everyone else is playing it. And you‚Äôre probably losing ‚Äî on salary, equity, and promotions. The good news is that because the other side is playing, they expect you to play along (especially at larger companies). So it rarely creates hard feelings when you negotiate. But you have to know how. And that‚Äôs where today‚Äôs post comes in.Since I‚Äôm so bad at this, I pulled in Niya Dragova, co-founder of Candor, to answer your question and to share her hard-earned negotiating wisdom with us. Niya has single-handedly helped hundreds of people negotiate their compensation at all of the top tech companies and, as you‚Äôll see below, has incredible insights into the process. I can honestly say this is the most useful post I‚Äôve ever come across on the topic, and I‚Äôm really excited to share it with you all. Enjoy!You can find Niya on LinkedIn and Twitter, you can learn more about Candor here, and don‚Äôt miss Niya‚Äôs insightful weekly newsletter that highlights hiring trends across the largest tech companies.The 10 commandments of salary negotiationby Niya DragovaThe largest salary increase I‚Äôve helped get was for a female FAANG executive: I helped her get $5.4M more on her offer. Through the process, it struck me that even though she was a senior leader everyone admired (you‚Äôd 100% know of her if I told you her name), she had very little knowledge of how to negotiate. Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äî she knew how to ask and be assertive, but she was much less comfortable ‚Äúplaying the game.‚ÄùAnd she‚Äôs not alone.Regardless of how senior or junior you are, most tech folks struggle with negotiation. Partially this is because compensation is set up to be intentionally misleading. Partially it‚Äôs because sticking up for yourself is nerve-racking AF.¬†Here are the 10 commandments to negotiation I wish everyone knew:¬†1. Negotiation starts earlier than you thinkEvery recruiter worth their salt will ask about your salary expectations when you first start interviewing. Do not ‚Äî I repeat, do not ‚Äî give them a number.What to do instead: Ask for the range they‚Äôre budgeted for the role.How to say it: ‚ÄúCan you tell me the salary band for this level? Happy to let you know if it‚Äôs within my range, and we can discuss specific numbers later when I‚Äôve met the team.‚ÄùBonus points: If you‚Äôre junior/mid, time all your interviews so you get offers around the same time. If you‚Äôre senior, get some press before you start meeting folks.2. Mine for intel during interviewsGo into the interview ready not just to answer questions but to ask some of your own. You will use this as ammunition to negotiate later. Here are a few examples of what you should ask:What‚Äôs the biggest priority for the team right now?Why is this role open?What‚Äôs the biggest challenge for someone stepping into this role?How does the org structure on the team work?3. Don‚Äôt give in to the pressureOnce you‚Äôve been offered the role, the recruiter‚Äôs job shifts from evaluating you to closing you. Most experienced recruiters will ask you again to put up a number for your salary. Clever recruiters may even tell you that they ‚Äúwill go to bat for you.‚Äù Yeah, no thanks.What recruiters say: ‚ÄúIf you give me your number, I will make it happen for you.‚ÄùWhat they mean: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get you something lower, but kinda close to what you asked for.‚Äù[Editors note: Some recruiters do indeed go to bat for you, and genuinely want to help you get what you want. Just don‚Äôt assume they all do.]4. At FAANG, your recruiter may have no say at allAt FAANG-size companies (i.e. over 5K employees), compensation is heavily formulaic. In fact, there is often a separate team ‚Äî the ‚Äúcompensation committee‚Äù ‚Äî who sets your salary. They take into account your background, interview performance, and level. They give the recruiter a number to go with. The recruiter then gives you the number, and every time you negotiate they have to go back to that committee to ask for a re-evaluation.What do clever recruiters do? They get your number up-front to save some legwork.Unfortunately, this may hurt your chances of getting more on your offer later. It also deprives you of some valuable data ‚Äî where you fall in the level/salary band. If you get caught in this loop, quickly turn the tables: most companies will consider ‚Äúnew information,‚Äù like another offer, to reopen a negotiation. Don‚Äôt forget, an offer to stay from your existing company also counts!5. Read between the linesYour initial offer speaks volumes, if you know how to interpret the data. Here are a few scenarios you should consider:Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre applying for an L6 role at a big company.¬†Initial offer comes in low: The team may have felt that you have a lot of ‚Äúroom for growth.‚Äù In this case, my advice is to dig deeper and ask the interviewer to share feedback from folks who met you to fix any misconceptions before you ever negotiate. Telling someone you want more money because you‚Äôre ‚Äúthe greatest PM ever‚Äù while the team felt you were ‚Äúmeh‚Äù is not going to fly.Middle of the road: You got ‚Äúthe number‚Äù (the medium opening number that‚Äôs basically a template recruiters use). It‚Äôs the most common opening offer ‚Äî companies do this to reduce risk of lawsuits. Over 80% of people get it. It likely means you don‚Äôt have a strong advocate on the interview loop. Do not negotiate until you match with a team and you have a manager batting for you.¬†Initial offer comes in top-of-band: There was likely a discussion about giving you a higher level. Many times in this case, you can push for an ‚Äúout-of-band‚Äù offer ‚Äî essentially getting paid for an L7 while you‚Äôre an L6.6. At a startup, the playbook is different¬†You may be dealing with the founder directly. It‚Äôs very likely there is no range for the role, as smaller companies have much less access to salary data. The goal at the initial offer conversation is to understand three things:The current state of the company (financing, runway, profitability)The plan for your role/functionThe value of the equity, considering exit scenariosThat last one can be tricky because you need data the recruiter may be reluctant to give ‚Äî the option strike price, preferred price, number of outstanding shares ‚Äî and you need to understand how options work. At last, get ready to ask:‚ÄúWhat is the valuation based on?‚ÄùAnd get ready to not get a straight answer until you‚Äôve asked five times (yes, this is normal).¬†TL;DR: Ask the questions an investor would ask because, *news flash*, you are now an investor ‚Äî but instead of cash, you‚Äôre staking your time and earning trajectory on the company‚Äôs success. You can meet with the investors too; it‚Äôs 100% OK to ask for that when the company is early-stage.Lastly, 2021 has been a weird year for startup compensation, so much of the data from previous years is unreliable. Remote work, abundant access to capital, and greater trust in international talent have skewed things quite a bit. Still, I find the Holloway Guide ranges to be a good starting point.7. Your job is to win hearts and mindsIt can be tempting to think you need to negotiate now that you have data. Nope, not yet. The next step, instead, is to upsell your worth before you come back with any kind of counteroffer. This is especially important if you‚Äôre going for a senior role.What to do next: Ask for follow-up meetings with decision makers. If you‚Äôre a Director or higher, you can usually ask to meet with any VP and possibly C-level execs. VPs can often meet with the CEO and even board members. Take your time; this is important if you want your salary to reflect your value. If everyone wants you, you‚Äôll be calling the shots later.How to run these effectively: Come prepared with three things, tailored to who you‚Äôre meeting:¬†Questions about how you can create meaningful impactIdeas based on your interviews so farBonus points: discussing obstacles to your taking the role and making them sell you on it8. OK, now get some good dataDid you know that women make only 47 cents in equity for every dollar a man makes? A HUGE reason for that is that many women don‚Äôt fully evaluate their offer before negotiating. Let‚Äôs change that. Particularly if you are a woman, ask yourself these questions:¬†Is the offer competitive? (Browse 5.3M offers here.)¬†How does it work? (When do I vest; what is the stock worth?)Is it all true? (Is the value of the equity over-inflated?)Does it add up? (Consider taxes on bonuses and stock.)If you have goaled comp, are the goals realistic?9. Comparing offersNot all offers are made equal ‚Äî in fact, they are intentionally confusing. At Google, you may get a front-loaded vesting schedule on your stock; at Amazon, sizable cash bonuses the first two years. It seems obvious that you should look at the comp, but that‚Äôs not everything:Which company has a better trajectory?How do promotions work?Is your manager influential enough to pull for you when needed?Is your product or team visible enough to get good resourcing?What‚Äôs the company brand worth to your earnings trajectory?TL;DR: Getting paid more up-front doesn‚Äôt always mean you‚Äôll make the most overall. Plan carefully.10. Time to make an askIt can be awkward to ask for more money, but trust me, everyone expects you to do it. On top of that, it doesn‚Äôt help that so much of the advice out there is conflicting. Let‚Äôs set the record straight:‚ÄúI need a competing offer.‚ÄùMYTH: You absolutely do not need multiple offers. Just being able to say you‚Äôre speaking to other companies is sufficient ‚Äî you can quote the expected salaries for other roles if needed.‚ÄúI need to provide copies of my other offers.‚ÄùMYTH: Nope, nope, nope (even though Google in particular loves to ask for them). You signed an NDA before every interview, so you can always use that as a reason.‚ÄúI should send the recruiter an email with my ask and justification.‚ÄùMYTH: Negotiating via email = MAJOR CRINGE and definitely a worse outcome. I know there are folks selling fill-in-the-blank templates out there. My advice if you want a meaningful/large increase is to have the conversation over the phone.¬†‚ÄúIf I find a number online, I can quote it as a reason to get more.‚ÄùMYTH: Nothing boils a recruiter‚Äôs blood more than ‚ÄúIt says X on Glassdoor.‚Äù Compensation is an exact science ‚Äî have arguments prepared that are specific to your situation.‚ÄúThe best way to get more is to reiterate how qualified I am.‚ÄùMYTH: You already got interviewed and everyone‚Äôs read your resume. That‚Äôs how you got your initial offer; now you need to build additional arguments. Use the information you collected during the interview about what challenges the team is facing ‚Äî maybe that increases the scope of the role? Discuss why leaving your current role will be hard ‚Äî are you critical to your current team? In other words: instead of asking for money, make them give you more money by bringing in obstacles the recruiter needs to overcome to close you.¬†‚ÄúI need to be aggressive and threaten to walk if they don‚Äôt match.‚ÄùMYTH: LOL, let me know how that goes for you. My guess is you‚Äôll get a mediocre increase worded as a ‚Äúfinal offer.‚Äù If you want big moves, I‚Äôm talking $100K+ more, you need to collaborate with your recruiter, not make them an enemy.As a final word of wisdom: Start with negotiating your overall compensation, not individual components. For example, ask for ‚Äú500K‚Äù and then the next round ask ‚ÄúCan I have X more equity?‚Äù Then, when you‚Äôve exhausted all other avenues, ask for a signing bonus. If you still need more help, you can always read our guide.¬†¬†Now that you‚Äôve got all these RSUs in your compensation‚Ä¶If your new RSUs are more than 10% of your liquid net worth, you should make a plan to diversify ASAP. Holding a concentrated position can translate into greater portfolio volatility, which has been shown to reduce compounded growth rates and future wealth.

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeTaking a short break from the B2B series, I‚Äôm thrilled to bring you an important guest post by Ethan Evans. During his 15 years at Amazon, Ethan helped invent Prime Video, Amazon Video, the Amazon Appstore, Prime Gaming (formerly Twitch Prime), and Twitch Commerce.¬†He led global teams of over 800, holds more than 70 patents, and helped draft one of Amazon‚Äôs 14 core Leadership Principles, ‚ÄúOwnership.‚ÄùBelow, for the first time publicly, Ethan shares one of his most important career frameworks, The Magic Loop. This framework helped him rise quickly in his own career, and has helped countless mentees and direct reports rise in theirs. I‚Äôm excited to share it with you here, and I can‚Äôt wait to hear how it goes when you implement it.Ethan is now working as a writer, career coach, and course instructor. He writes a newsletter, Level Up, which publishes candid career advice twice a week, and offers a range of Leadership Development Courses that go in-depth on topics like ‚ÄúBreaking Through to Executive,‚Äù ‚ÄúManaging Up Successfully,‚Äù ‚ÄúLeadership Networking,‚Äù and more. If you‚Äôd like to connect, you can find Ethan on LinkedIn.The Magic Loop is a process through which any employee may systematically grow at a company. It is reliable in its results, with a simple core of five basic steps. In this post, we first present the Loop in its most straightforward model. We then follow up with variations, optimizations, and special circumstances that users will find over time.Asking to do moreIn my first job, I went from having just left graduate school to managing a team of 10 in only two years. I did this by seeing unmet needs and asking my manager about filling them. I‚Äôve repeated this pattern throughout my career, all the way up to my last role at Amazon. It worked at every step along the way. In my second job, I was hired as a director, then given more responsibility through an acquisition. In my third job, I was promoted to vice president before I turned 30. At Amazon, my responsibilities grew from an initial team of six to more than 800. Along the way, I helped create household products you would recognize, including Prime Video, Kindle, Alexa, Twitch, and Prime Gaming. At every step, I followed the Magic Loop. Since then, I have worked both with leaders on my team and clients of my coaching practice to use the Magic Loop themselves.¬†It worked for them and can work for you.The Magic LoopThe heart of the Magic Loop consists of five steps. Some of these steps will require substantial time and effort, but they lead to not just rapid career growth but also a great relationship with your manager. The Loop is used to grow both your personal skills and abilities as well as your career, responsibilities, and compensation.The steps:Do your current job wellAsk your manager how you can help themDo what they askAsk your manager if you could help in a way that also grows your skills toward a particular goalDo as they suggest, and repeat in a loop from step 4Why the magic worksThe ‚Äúmagic‚Äù in this loop relies on simple human nature. We have a natural sense of fair play and partnership, and we want to invest in people we view as having our best interests at heart. The magic in the loop is building a collaborative, mutually beneficial relationship. We will also cover exceptions, such as the rare manager who is exploitative or dishonest, later in this discussion.The core loopStep 1: Do your current job wellManagers always need help. They always have work that needs to be done and are wondering how to get it all done. As a result, they normally welcome offers of help and look positively on those making such an offer.The exception to this is when they feel that the person asking is not doing their current job well. In that case, what they are thinking is, ‚ÄúThe way you could help is to do what I have already asked you to do, well and on time.‚ÄùTherefore, before you can move to step two of the Magic Loop, you need to first be an employee in good standing in terms of performance with your current responsibilities. Note that this is an ongoing challenge. Workplaces and projects change. Further, when you practice the steps in the Loop, over time you will take on new responsibilities and you may struggle with them. Thus it is important to verify with your manager that you are doing your current job well. The simplest way to do this is to ask, in a non-threatening manner. This is not hard to do but can be scary, because there is the possibility that the manager will say no and ask for improvements.A good way to ask is to wait until a relatively quiet time, when there is no crisis going on (or less of one than usual, for a chaotic workplace), and ask your manager if you can talk with them for a few minutes. Sit down (a non-threatening posture) and say something like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while since I last checked in with you. I want to do a good job here and be helpful. I was wondering if you could tell me how you feel I am doing.‚Äù Then, no matter what they say in response, say thank you. Do not argue. At most, ask for an example if you receive a complaint.The rest of how to take feedback well is another topic beyond our scope in this article. If the feedback you got when you asked was basically good, you are clear to move on to step two. If not, you must address the feedback and re-verify good job performance before moving on.At my first job, where I did quality-control work for equipment made by our partner company, the engineering manager at that company complained that I was disrupting his team. He was nice about it; he told me he could see that I was trying to help and had good intentions, but that I was pestering his engineers about problems so much that they could not focus.I was working hard and I was calling out valid problems. In my eyes, I was doing my job and succeeding. But the way I was doing my work was causing problems for others. Few people intentionally do poor work. But without asking for feedback, you may have no idea how your work is being received. I learned to prioritize the problems I found and channel them through a process. I could only take on more once I addressed the feedback.Step 2: Ask your manager how you can helpOnce you are seen as doing great work and have your current job under control, ask your boss what more you can do to help them. Managers always need help. For some managers, they may need a bit of prompting if offers to help are unusual in your workplace. Some managers can be suspicious of such offers or may not have anything in mind right at that instant. In such cases, offer to check back in a week or so, giving them time to think about it. Often, once a manager knows you are willing to help, they will come to you with a request the next time a need arises.One great way to shortcut this process is to raise your hand or volunteer when a new task comes up. Often in a meeting, something will come up that needs to be done, and the manager will be trying to figure out who to give it to. Some of your peers will be looking down at their laptops or phones, trying to avoid being chosen. The easiest way to help your manager is to simply volunteer to take on the task. It is clear that it is something that your manager wants to have done, and you can be the hero. Believe me, as a manager, we notice who steps up to help us.Step 3: Do what you are askedOnce a manager makes a request, even if it was not the work you were hoping for, make an honest attempt to help. It is natural to want to be assigned the new, high-profile work, or tasks that perfectly suit our interests. However, often what managers need help with are the more operational tasks. In software engineering, the classic examples of such work fall into the maintenance category‚Äîmigrating servers, applying patches, and fixing bugs. Good managers want to balance the work and match it to their employees‚Äô desires. If you really want to get the most impact from step three, it may help if you take on an extra share of some of the work that others may be avoiding or that may not be getting done at all. You‚Äôll be able to turn this into credit to move your career forward in the next step!Do the work as well as you can. You must meet the bar of step one (do a good job) with this work to continue. If the work is truly beyond your skills (not your willingness), then you will need to be politely clear about that and ask for pointers, resources, or aid in doing the work. Be clear that you are willing to do all you can but that you are concerned about failing and leaving the manager worse off. Frame any request like this in terms of helping the manager (protecting them from your nascent ability) rather than about you (say, that you are afraid of the challenge or the hard work).Step 4: Ask your manager how you can help, in line with one of your career goalsAfter you are doing a good job and have shown that you can and will put in extra effort to help out by completing steps one through three of the Magic Loop, you will be in a position to ask for work that helps you advance a career goal. This is because it is human nature to be inclined to help those who have helped you. So after you have first helped out the manager, they are more likely to help you in return. Note that if you have a good manager who invests in the careers of their team members, you may be able to skip step three altogether and jump straight here. This depends on your manager‚Äîif they have shown interest in growing the careers and abilities of their team members, then you can go straight to asking for the work that helps you grow.I have confirmed again and again with many managers that they are very rarely offered help and that they appreciate it. Simply the act of offering help will make you stand out.To move to this step, you have to have some idea of what you would like to achieve. This can be anything from learning a new skill to developing an ability you already have. It can also include getting more responsibility, a raise, or a promotion. If your goal is simple, you can ask directly in one statement, as in ‚ÄúIs there a way I could help you out while working with [piece of technology or specific skill] so that I can learn and improve?‚ÄùIf your goal is more complex, such as a major promotion, you probably cannot ask in one large request, such as ‚ÄúIs there a way I can help so that I can be promoted?‚Äù Rather, you have to frame it and say, ‚ÄúOne day I‚Äôd like to be promoted. Could I help out in a way that you think would develop me toward that goal?‚ÄùLenny has already written a great article about the kinds of performance reviews a good manager should deliver.¬†As you work with your manager, you can use this as a model of the kind of feedback and detailed plans you want to develop with them.¬†¬†Step 5: Repeat the loopYou may wonder why the ‚Äúrepeat‚Äù part needs any explanation. Partly, it depends on where you repeat. Sometimes you only go back to step four and do something else that both helps you grow or advance and that helps your manager. Sometimes you have to revisit step one and make sure that you are doing a great job even with new and more challenging tasks. Finally, you may have to update your goals or make sure that your manager is clear and on board with them. So, for example, if your goal is a raise or promotion, you may need to make sure that you and your manager are aligned on exactly what that will take.I asked for opportunities and promotions many times in my career. I was also constantly asked about growth and promotion by my direct reports. I am proud to say that my top-performing direct reports now hold higher positions than I did when I retired. People who worked for me are now company founders and executives all over the industry.As one specific example, a young man who came to me in 2005 as a Software Engineer II at Amazon went on to be a VP of Engineering at Google and has recently joined a new company as an Executive Vice President. He did it through the Magic Loop‚Äîby doing a great job, asking for more, and then doing that new work well.Advanced forms of the Magic LoopThe Magic Loop is strong, but you can make it even stronger. Once you master the basics and begin building a collaborative relationship with your manager, the methods in this section will let you take it even further.1. Suggest your own ideasIn the simple form of the Magic Loop, you ask your manager what they need help to accomplish. However, as you understand your group and your company, you should be able to anticipate what needs to be done. In this model you evolve from asking what needs to be done to suggesting things that you can do that you believe will help. This approach involves confirming your ideas rather than simply offering help.To suggest an idea, use language with your manager like, ‚ÄúI noticed that we are often late on projects because we forget to account for vacation schedules and then someone critical is out. I‚Äôve been thinking that I could implement a step in our planning and update process that captures these. Would that be helpful, or is there something else you would like me to do?‚ÄùNote that the ending question is very important. It both asks if this would be helpful and it implies the offer to do something else that the manager prefers if they have other priorities. This kind of response makes managers feel comfortable that they have the choice, but avoids the need for them to come up with the ideas. Managers will start seeing you as more than just helpful; they will see you as innovative and proactive as well.2. Just do itUltimately, as you learn your manager‚Äôs and company‚Äôs style well, you can slowly start to just do what you see that needs to be done. That is, as trust with your manager grows, you can simply see what is needed, know what the manager will likely want done, do it, and mention it in your next discussion. ‚ÄúI noticed we often miss vacations in our schedules. I went ahead and fixed that by adding a step to solicit and document holiday plans with the team.‚Äù At this point, your manager will start to see you as helpful, innovative, and autonomous. This is the best thing for a manager‚Äîsomeone who does their job and who then additionally magically helps out without needing to be asked or told.As my career progressed, I changed almost entirely to this final style. I would see what my business at Amazon that I owned as a vice president needed in order to grow and succeed, and I would just go do it. The strongest star performers blend all three styles.Occasionally it is good to ask your manager what they need, because they may have needs based on information outside of your purview. It is also good to get their input on your biggest suggestions so that they can help make them better and feel part of the result. Finally, it is fastest to¬†simply see what is needed and get it done. A blend of approaches, a collaborative team effort between you and your manager, is the end goal. You know you have succeeded when your relationship with your manager is less of a boss/employee structure and more of a partnership.Manager problems and how to handle themThe Magic Loop is designed to work with your manager to grow your career.¬†What should you do if you don‚Äôt think your manager is very good, or you don‚Äôt have a good relationship with them, or they don‚Äôt give you good projects, ideas, or feedback?Start with yourselfIt is easy to blame others for our problems, but none of us are perfect people or ideal employees.¬†Further, we do not control what our managers do; we only control ourselves.¬†Thus, even if your manager is not ideal, you can work on your own performance.¬†If your manager gives you no feedback or you strongly disagree with it, get additional feedback from your own peers as well as peers at the next level.¬†Do not just seek out people who will say nice things about you.¬†Use this process to find out: is my manager truly wrong, or do other people say versions of the same thing?¬†Whether others say the same things or different things, in every single case I have ever seen, broad feedback has revealed places for improvement.¬†Get to work on those.Build the relationshipThe whole idea of the Magic Loop is to form a cooperative relationship with your manager where you both win.¬†The manager gets a motivated employee who works on critical projects, while you get a career advocate.¬†If you are starting with a poor relationship with your manager, or with a manager who does not seem to invest much in you or other team members, then this process may take longer. But it is a rare human who turns their back on those who help them.¬†Most managers can be won over by people who volunteer to help them and then follow through. However, you have to get past your disappointment with past interactions as well as any resentment you may be harboring.¬†To improve any relationship, someone must take the risk to take the first step.¬†This does mean that it is possible that you will put in some extra work helping your manager and they will not change. What we can also guarantee, though, is that if you do nothing different than you have in your past (that is, you refuse to take risks or change, waiting for them to ‚Äúget better at managing‚Äù first), then your career will stay stuck right where it is.¬†If you take the risk and try, then either something improves or you can know that this manager is not going to be a supporter and that your next step is to change roles.Suggest your own ideasSometimes managers are not good at helping you plan your career.¬†They give poor feedback, such as ‚ÄúJust keep doing what you are doing!‚Äù¬†They have few suggestions where you can grow.¬†They offer no ideas for projects you can take on that would grow your skills and career.¬†In other cases, their ideas of what direction you should take your career do not match your own (for example, they recommend a management track when you want to grow as an expert in your field instead). In all of these cases, you will need to suggest your own ideas of what you want to work on and how you can grow in the way you want for your career.¬†To do this successfully, you need to consider what the manager, team, and company need from you.¬†This is because for your suggestions to be accepted, they do have to accomplish something of value for the manager and the company.¬†If your suggestion is only good for you, it will likely be rejected.¬†Thus, the key task is to work to figure out and explain a win-win recommendation that is good for both of you.As a last resort, leaveIf you try all the steps above and your manager remains unhelpful or is exploitative (see below), then you need to find a new manager. The first mistake I see people make is blaming the manager without truly looking at their own performance issues first. The second mistake, however, is simply complaining about the manager but staying in the job.¬†I have seen many employees complain about their jobs and managers for years without doing anything about it.¬†Both approaches are wrong. The successful employee does everything they can to make a situation work but then also quickly exits the role if it cannot be repaired.Frequently asked questions about the Magic LoopIf I keep volunteering for work, won‚Äôt I end up being overloaded?This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

Art by Natalie Harney.If you‚Äôve come here looking for a step-by-step guaranteed guide to finding product-market fit, you‚Äôre going to be disappointed. No such guide exists. Nor will one ever exist. Finding PMF is too squishy. As Rick Rubin said in his recent book The Creative Act, ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre aiming to create works that are exceptional, most rules don‚Äôt apply.‚ÄùHowever, there is hope. Though there‚Äôs no formula for finding PMF, you can significantly increase your odds, and save yourself a lot of time and heartache, by studying the lessons of those who‚Äôve made it. I interviewed more than 20 of today‚Äôs most successful B2B founders, and from their stories, I‚Äôve found:A simple framework for moving closer to PMFReliable signs that you‚Äôre approaching PMFHow long it should take you to find PMFAdvice for what to do if you aren‚Äôt finding PMFLet‚Äôs get into it.In B2B, it normally takes two years to start feeling product-market fitHere‚Äôs an overview of how long it took 24 of today‚Äôs top B2B startups to get to (1) a live product, (2) their first customer, and (3) their first feeling of PMF:Timelines include pivots, e.g. Slack spent first 3.5 years working on a game called Glitch before pivotingThe median time from idea to feeling product-market fit was roughly 2 years. Start to worry if you‚Äôve been working on your idea for over 2 years and not feeling PMF (see below what that feels like), and start to seriously worry if it‚Äôs been over 3 years.From a working product to feeling PMF typically took 9-18 months. Expect to spend a year or so iterating before you finally have something people want.Most companies got an alpha product out the door in 1-3 months. Unless you think you‚Äôre the next Figma, get your V1 out quickly.A few companies‚ÄîFigma, Airtable, Slack‚Äîtook 4+ years to find PMF, but they were the exceptions, and Slack was working on a completely different product (a game) before pivoting to what became Slack.Additional takeaways and surprises from the insights belowIf you build it, they will come‚Äîif you have strong product-market fit.Stop thinking of product-market fit as a yes or no question‚Äîbut instead as a process of finding fit with more segments of the market.Surprisingly, no founders I spoke with used retention as their signal of PMF. It might have been implicit, but if you read the quotes, that wasn‚Äôt really ever the main story.The journey to PMF starts by finding just one company to truly love your product.One of the most interesting takeaways from my interviews is how often founders never fully felt PMFShishir Mehrotra (co-founder and CEO of Coda) described this feeling so well:‚ÄúMy problem with the term is that you always have product-market fit with one group and not with the next. The group that you haven‚Äôt achieved product-market fit with is the one you really want to target.It always surprises people to hear that, at YouTube, we never thought we had a product-market fit. We had 100 million DAUs and almost a billion monthly actives, and yet we did not have our desired audience. We had teenagers but not adults. We were envious of the satisfaction those folks were finding on Netflix, Facebook, or wherever. In my experience, you‚Äôre always stretching product-market fit. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a moment where you‚Äôre done with product-market fit.‚ÄùYou may not feel like you have PMF even when you reach 100 customers:‚ÄúI remember with the first 100 or so customers, every customer kind of felt like the last customer we would get, to be honest. We were like, I can‚Äôt believe DoorDash is using this product. That‚Äôs incredible! We were so proud. Unlike on the B2C side, there was no sort of viral loop that got going that made us think, ‚ÄòOkay, we found it.‚Äô Instead, it really was kind of just pushing the boulder at a pretty steep trajectory uphill, over and over.‚Äù‚ÄîDavid Hsu, founder and CEO of RetoolOr at $100M/year in revenue:‚ÄúThe fear of hitting a wall and collapsing was always there. Even when we were at 100 million in revenue, there was always this fear that we were suddenly going to crash into a wall and everything would stop.There are all these horror stories in Silicon Valley of these companies who got to 150 or 200 million revenue and then didn‚Äôt grow. So there was always this fear that it was going to happen to us as well. Your product-market fit is always with respect to a particular market. It might be small companies, or medium-size companies, or enterprises. The small companies don‚Äôt want your stuff, or the U.S. market doesn‚Äôt want your stuff, or the Asian market, and so on. Eventually, at some point you become a multi-product company, so then the whole game repeats itself again and again and again. You have to revamp and change things significantly, which is its own challenge.‚Äù‚ÄîAli Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO of DatabricksIn fact, you might never fully feel PMF:‚ÄúI never felt at any point of time like, ah, now I have product-market fit. I always felt like there was always something for us to improve on‚Äîwhether it was growth or product or customer care. I‚Äôm always seeing what more we can do to solve problems on behalf of our customers.‚Äù‚ÄîTomer London, co-founder and CPO of Gusto‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent most of the history of Hex paranoid that we‚Äôre not at PMF, or there‚Äôs more to do. I think our vision is big enough and that, at any point, even when I have thousands of people telling us this thing is awesome, I still feel like, ‚ÄòYeah, but there‚Äôs this bigger thing we want to do.‚Äô I don‚Äôt feel like we have product-market fit for the ultimate vision we have yet. And so that‚Äôll take time, obviously.‚Äù‚ÄîBarry McCardel, co-founder and CEO of Hex‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know if today we have true product-market fit. If you‚Äôre going down the venture path, what I tell other founders is that anytime you raise, your product-market fit is gone, because whatever you raised, the next raise effectively demolished it. You now have to hit the next bar of product-market fit. What we have today at the series A and series B, I consider it strong product-market fit. But that‚Äôs because we were able to grow into the valuation and what the stature of the company should have been at those respective stages.‚Äù‚ÄîRick Song, founder and CEO of PersonaPMF is never a binary yes-or-no moment. It‚Äôs instead a gradual process of finding fit with larger and larger segments, as Jori Lallo, co-founder of Linear, describes:‚ÄúPMF has been so gradual; I might even say . . . linear. There‚Äôs not just one hump that we got over and thought, ‚ÄòOkay, now it‚Äôs clicking.‚Äô It‚Äôs more like we‚Äôre chipping away at these obstacles and getting more and more people interested. It‚Äôs more like, ‚ÄòOh, this is really working for certain segments.‚Äô‚ÄùA guide for finding product-market fitThough you may never feel everlasting product-market fit, you need to start somewhere. I asked every founder when they first felt product-market fit, and their answers fell along a spectrum that provides a useful guide to finding ever-increasing PMF:Step 1: Get one company to love your productStep 2: Get one company to pay (a meaningful amount of money) for your productStep 3: Get more than one company to love and pay for your productStep 4: Start noticing a shift from push to pull, and organic growthStep 5: Keep growing consistentlyBelow, I‚Äôll explore each step in-depth, and share stories from founders of the moment they finally felt PMF.Step 1: Get one company to love your productStart your PMF journey by becoming obsessed with getting one company to love, use, and continue to use your product. Do whatever it takes to make them successful.In the case of Figma, co-founder Dylan Field became obsessed with the success of their first real user, Coda (originally called Krypton):‚ÄúThere was a weekend when we had a bug and the product wasn‚Äôt working very well because it hadn‚Äôt been released yet; it was an alpha. And Dylan was freaking out. He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a bug.‚Äô And I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòYeah, we‚Äôll fix it, but we‚Äôve got other stuff going on.‚Äô He‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòWe have to call a red alert.‚Äô I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòDude, what are you talking about? We haven‚Äôt shipped this thing yet. There‚Äôs no such thing as a red alert because it‚Äôs not shipped.‚Äô And he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt understand. There are customers depending on us. There‚Äôs this company called Krypton.‚Äô So I was like, ‚ÄòOkay, they haven‚Äôt paid us any money, nobody even knows we exist, but I guess we‚Äôll deal with it.‚ÄôI actually came to appreciate Dylan‚Äôs mindset, because a lot of founders don‚Äôt give a shit about their customers. They want to understand the customers, but just enough to figure out what features they would be willing to pay for. But at the end of the day, Dylan was thinking about it in terms of trust. He was like, ‚ÄòLook, I convinced this guy to use our product. They‚Äôre actually trying to use it for work, and if we fuck it up for them, I don‚Äôt want that on my conscience. I want to do whatever I can to make sure that we‚Äôre holding up our end of the bargain. Because they believed in me.‚ÄôThey‚Äôre still customers; they were our first customer.‚Äù‚ÄîSho Kuwamoto, VP of ProductCoda itself went through this same journey with their first customer, Springful:‚ÄúMy former colleague Noam Lovinsky [now CPO at Grammarly] was starting a company called Springful. I said to him, ‚ÄòHey, would you use Krypton [our name at the time]?‚Äô They started using it, and for a while, it went well. They were getting a lot of use out of it. We had a chart of what the DAUs looked like, and because they had six employees, the chart basically sat at 6 every day, except for on the weekends.Then one day, it dropped to zero on a weekday, and the following day, it stayed at zero. And so I texted Noam and said, ‚ÄòHey, what happened? Are you at an offsite?‚Äô I was trying to find some other excuse. He said, ‚ÄòOh man, I‚Äôve been putting off calling you, but I have good news and bad news. The bad news is we had a team meeting and I asked the team how things were going, and they said that if we made them keep using Krypton, they were all going to quit.‚Äô And I was like, ‚ÄòWell, that‚Äôs pretty terrible news.‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòThe good news is they all completely believe in the vision. They‚Äôve made a list [in Krypton] saying, ‚ÄòIf you do these things, we‚Äôll come right back.‚Äô The list was like 25 things, all completely reasonable.This led to a big internal debate. The team was basically divided in half. Half the folks had a mindset like, ‚ÄòWhat a gift. We have a customer and they have given us a clear list of requirements.‚Äô The other half said, ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs reacting to the wrong product‚Äîit‚Äôs not actually the shape of the thing we want. And if we do that, we‚Äôre going to dig a hole deeper and deeper into this part of the product.‚ÄôWe decided not to finish his list. Instead, we built the doc that we originally envisioned. I thought it would take three or four months, but it took over a year to get back to his list.‚Äù‚ÄîShishir Mehrotra, co-founder and CEODavid Hsu at Retool built a tool to catch anyone running into issues with their early product so that they could fix the issues immediately:‚ÄúAt the beginning of any startup, no one knows about your product, nor does anyone use it. We came to a point where we‚Äôre like, given that no one‚Äôs using the product, every time somebody‚Äôs using the product, we should go see what they‚Äôre doing. So we built this custom analytics server along with FullStory, and anytime anyone was in the app and using the app, we got notified immediately on Slack.Invariably, they‚Äôd run into a bunch of issues. And anytime they ran into any issue, we‚Äôd immediately reach out. We‚Äôd just call them. With sales, oftentimes when you call a customer, they don‚Äôt reply or they don‚Äôt want to talk to you. But in this case, they were literally using the product and they‚Äôre running into issues, and so they were super-likely to pick up.With DoorDash, for example, the product went through multiple iterations over three weeks, where they‚Äôd uncover an issue and we‚Äôd respond, ‚ÄòNo problem, we‚Äôre on it.‚Äô We‚Äôd ship the feature, they‚Äôd come back the next day, it would work. They wanted an on-prem option, which is at that point a pretty big feature, as you can probably imagine, putting a cloud product on-prem. We‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòNo problem.‚Äô And we shipped it¬†in just 36 hours. So we were iterating very rapidly, even if the core idea was the same.‚ÄùThe founders of Gong did exactly the same thing:‚ÄúDuring the beta process, we had a bunch of systems that recorded the users‚Äô screens using Gong. And we were watching these like maniacs, every day. I would probably spend two hours watching people interact with the system, reverse engineering them based on their role or what they were trying to do, and then go on thinking, ‚ÄòSo this is what this person is doing?‚Äô And if needed, I would give them a call. This approach is an underutilized product management tool, because in some areas it gives you more information than a quantitative survey or a discussion, because this is what the person actually does versus what they tell you and what they think they‚Äôre doing.‚Äù‚ÄîEilon Reshef, co-founder and CPOThe founders of Gusto literally sat next to their early customers watching them send payroll day after day:‚ÄúFor the first 30 customers, I was with them in their offices seeing them do payroll, or I was on the phone with them, watching them and then seeing them send payroll, and their reactions and seeing feedback. What‚Äôs working, what‚Äôs not working, what‚Äôs intuitive, what‚Äôs not intuitive. Every time they added an employee, I was there on the phone with them or in their office.‚Äù‚ÄîTomer London, co-founder and CPOThe founders of Looker are famous for going even further and ‚Äúforward deploying‚Äù their engineers to sit in the customer‚Äôs offices and work alongside their team to make sure they‚Äôre set up for success:‚ÄúThe best way to show a prospect or customer the real value of Looker was to show them on their own data. Its power came from being designed as both a language and a development platform, but that also came with a lot of overhead to learn how to be powerful with it. It wasn‚Äôt rocket science; it just took time. Therefore, we created a team of data analysts to serve as our technical customer-facing teams (sales engineers, customer support, and implementation analysts) to quickly deploy and develop instances of Looker for our customer. Early on, this enabled us to see and know everything that our customers and prospects wanted to achieve with analytics. Having that insight, we were able to both develop features and ways to use Looker, almost daily, to ensure we would be the best choice for a powerful analytics platform. This also helped us ensure that our customers would find value from Looker on day 1 after purchasing.‚Äù‚ÄîKeenan Rice, founding team‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt be great for anyone. Just get the thing to be really damn useful for one customer.‚Äù ‚ÄîBarry McCardel, co-founder and CEO of HexOne of the biggest recurring lessons from my conversations is to talk to customers more. I know you hear this a lot, but you are probably still not talking to customers enough. Here‚Äôs Spenser Skates‚Äôs (co-founder and CEO of Amplitude) hard-won lesson:‚ÄúWe spent about a year building, when in retrospect, we should have spent half that time talking to customers. And if we had, we would‚Äôve wasted a lot less time on customers who were never going to buy.The biggest thing I will tell founders is, you have to spend half your time talking to your customers. If you‚Äôre a B2B company, that means becoming a salesperson. Figure out how to spend the collective time of your founding team: 50% needs to be talking to customers. If you‚Äôre a consumer company, that just means talking to them and meeting them. Airbnb was very famous for doing this. And spend the other 50% of your time building.I‚Äôm an engineer. My two co-founders, Curtis [Liu] and Jeffrey [Wang], are engineers. And so our instinct is to always build the product because we know how to solve those problems. But we wasted a lot of time solving problems that didn‚Äôt really exist or didn‚Äôt have money or traction behind them. And so that was a huge lesson for us.‚ÄùAt this stage, you may not even have true ‚Äúproduct‚Äù-market fit, if your product is early. Instead, you can look for ‚Äúmessage‚Äù-market fit, as in the case of Ramp:‚ÄúWhen we launched, in mid-2020, I think we had ‚Äòmessage-market fit.‚Äô We were able to differentiate and have people be interested in our unique messaging, but we didn‚Äôt have the product there yet.I think it‚Äôs hard to have true product-market fit when you‚Äôre public. When you‚Äôre operating just on friends and founders you meet and VC introductions. You need to have people out in the world who you don‚Äôt know you but are using you, and the product is what‚Äôs doing the selling.And in terms of the product itself, where suddenly it was spreading, that came later, probably fall of 2020, when it was finally delivering on the messaging we had.In terms of feeling market-message fit, there‚Äôs a few ways you can test it. One, based on launch press coverage, e.g. who wants to talk about it. You send an email using cold outbound and look at response rates. SDRs can do that all the time, and we were testing that all the time, even in an elevator pitch. Would people get it or would they be turned off? You can be very technical about it. You measure it or you can just sort of go by feel.‚Äù‚ÄîEric Glyman, co-founder and CEOOr ‚Äúproduct-user fit,‚Äù as in the case of Snyk:‚ÄúI separate the ‚Äòproduct-user fit‚Äô from ‚Äòproduct-buyer fit.‚Äô We got the former pretty quickly, I‚Äôd say within a year after we launched our Git integration. The latter‚Äî getting people to pay for it and aligning with their commercial needs‚Äîtook a full extra year to happen.‚Äù‚ÄîGuy Podjarny, co-founder and CEORemember, trust is your secret weapon early on.Step 2: Get one company to pay (a meaningful amount of money) for your productThe next PMF milestone is to get one company to pay a meaningful amount of money for your product. This should be five to six figures per year. I‚Äôll share pricing advice below.For Vanta, getting the first five-figure verbal agreement, and then a $500k deal, convinced Christina Cacioppo that she had found PMF:‚ÄúDuring the pricing research, when folks overwhelmingly said they‚Äôd pay five figures for the Wizard of Oz prototype of a real-time security report. They thought it was generated by code, but I definitely wrote them by hand.Then, when I was able to sell the first $500k of Vanta by myself, when I didn‚Äôt really know how to sell. I joke that prior to Vanta, the last thing I sold was Girl Scout cookies. I knew it wasn‚Äôt my sales skill that was getting these deals closed; it was a testament to the problem we were solving and the product we were building.‚ÄùFor Stytch, it was getting their first six-figure deal:‚ÄúFor me, it was probably our first six-figure deal when it was like, ‚ÄòOh crap, a company will actually pay us for this.‚Äô I just remember being consistently surprised that they didn‚Äôt say no to the prices that we were putting in front of them.‚Äù‚ÄîJulianna Lamb and Reed McGinley-Stempel, co-foundersIf you have early users telling you that you need to take their money, like with Figma and GitHub, you‚Äôre in a good spot:‚ÄúI think I didn‚Äôt admit it to ourselves until we had a customer, Microsoft, that told us, ‚ÄòHey, you have to start charging for this thing.‚Äô I thought we might have product-market fit. In reality we‚Äôd had it for like a year, and I wish that I had recognized that sooner, because I think I would have acted differently.‚Äù‚ÄîDylan Field, co-founder and CEO of Figma, via fireside chat with Elad Gil‚ÄúWhen we launched our private beta, we were offering it for free. To our surprise, users started writing to us asking, ‚ÄòCan we pay for this?‚Äô They liked it so much, they wanted to pay for it. That was the first sign this was going to work.‚Äù‚ÄîTom Preston-Werner, first CEO and co-founder of GitHubWhen thinking about pricing, the best advice is to charge more than you think you should.‚ÄúI was talking to this company called Super Lucky Casino. I went through the demo and the whole pitch, and we got to the end of it, and they asked me a question I‚Äôd never been asked. They‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòThis is great, how much does it cost?‚Äô And I‚Äôm like, holy shit, someone wants to pay money for the software I built. I am blown away. And the first thought that popped into my head was like, okay, what‚Äôs SaaS supposed to cost? I‚Äôm thinking $50 a month. But then I remember Patrick McKenzie‚Äôs advice, which is, ‚ÄòCharge more.‚Äô So I‚Äôm like, all right, what‚Äôs the biggest number I can think of? Well, let me double that number. So maybe $100 a month? Then I thought, wait, no, no, no, no, no. Let me try adding another zero to it. I said ‚Äò$1,000 a month.‚Äô And the guy who we were pitching, the CTO of Super Lucky Casino, was like, ‚ÄòHoly smokes, wow, that‚Äôs so cheap, amazing.‚Äô And I‚Äôm like, oh my god, all my dreams have been fulfilled. Someone wants to buy the software that I wrote for $1,000 a month. This is incredible.‚Äù‚ÄîSpenser Skates, co-founder and CEO of AmplitudeAnd it goes without saying, if these early customers leave, they don‚Äôt count. Retention is key, especially early on.Step 3: Get more than one company to love and pay for your productNext, you need to get multiple companies paying for your product. For most founders, hitting 3 to 10 paid customers was the moment they felt like they had real PMF.For Amplitude, Spenser Skates felt PMF once they signed their first half-dozen customers (at increasingly higher prices):‚ÄúAfter our first customer, Super Lucky Casino, signed, came Keepsafe, which we sold for $2,000 a month. Then it was The Hunt for $3,000 a month. And then we sold to HERE Maps, which is a division of Nokia, for $4,000 a month. And then we did a few more deals. Rdio and QuizUp were the two big deals; those were $10,000 a month. We were really cranking. We got from zero to a million in ARR in less than nine months. And so that was really where we started taking off.‚ÄùGong felt like they had product-market fit when 11 out of 12 of their design partners chose to buy the product:‚ÄúWe had 12 design partners. We gave them the software in January. In May, we made a decision to tell them the betas were over and that we‚Äôd start charging for it. Out of 12, 11 ended up buying. So that‚Äôs a pretty big signal.By the way, the reason why we decided to charge money is that during beta, the product wasn‚Äôt always working very well. It wasn‚Äôt robust in any way or form, and people were complaining left and right when it wasn‚Äôt working. So we were like, well, if they are complaining that it doesn‚Äôt work, that means they care. If my iPhone doesn‚Äôt work, I freak out. But if home speakers don‚Äôt work, I don‚Äôt give a shit, just like whatever. So that gave us the confidence that at least they use it.Then we went to charge money for it. With 11 out of the 12 buying, it should have been obvious. But it wasn‚Äôt obvious to us. It was like, how come the 12th didn‚Äôt buy it?We later learned that the 12th one‚Äôs CRO left while we were doing the beta, and they bought Gong a year later and are still a customer.One of 11: the salespeople at one point decided they didn‚Äôt need it, and turned it off. A day later, we got a call from the CEO saying, who the fuck told you to turn it off? That‚Äôs the type of feedback you want to hear to feel like you have product-market fit.‚Äù‚ÄîEilon Reshef, co-founder and CPOFor both Zip and Persona, they finally felt they found PMF after closing their 10th customer:‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we felt PMF until we had our first 10 customers live and very successful. This took just over a year from the time we committed to the idea. I distinctly remember a deal where our champion cried because her manager hadn‚Äôt approved budget for Zip. She actually quit her job because of it (and is now a customer). That was a telling moment.‚Äù‚ÄîRujul Zaparde and Lu Cheng, co-founders‚ÄúIn the earliest early phases, the only really meaningful measure of product-market fit is whether you can close more than 10 customers, and you think you can close more.‚Äù‚ÄîRick Song, founder and CEOWith each new customer, you‚Äôll start to feel more and more confident that you‚Äôve got something special, and you should start to feel a pull.Step 4: Start noticing a shift from push to pull, and organic growthThis post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

Grab your copy today.Order The Best of Lenny's NewsletterQ: What are your favorite decision-making frameworks?Companies live and die by the quality of their decisions. One better decision can change the trajectory of your business. Yet important decisions often get mired in head-banging meetings, debates, and consensus seeking. And as your company grows, you‚Äôll inevitably run into decision-making challenges.Below I‚Äôll share several battle-tested decision-making frameworks that are designed to help you make better decisions more quickly and with less drama. Although no framework will make hard decisions easy, having a framework can significantly cut down on the head banging.First, a few caveats:Prioritize trust: If your team is asking you to use a decision-making framework on many decisions, it could be a sign they don‚Äôt super-trust your judgment. Before running every decision through a framework, dig into this potential issue. You‚Äôre better off long-term getting things done through influence and trust, versus jumping to a framework. That being said, as your company scales and the number of stakeholders grows, even with high trust there‚Äôs often a need for a structured process to make sure everyone‚Äôs voice is heard.Save frameworks for big (one-way-door) decisions: As Gokul Rajaram put it, ‚Äú[A decision-making] framework isn‚Äôt meant for every situation. It‚Äôs meant for hard decisions. Things that would have real consequences for a company or group. Not all decisions are important. At Square, we used to jokingly call this the ‚Äòkombucha scale,‚Äô which captures two variables: importance and urgency. If the choice is as simple as selecting a flavor of kombucha, everyone can save the time and effort spent on a thorough decision-making process.‚ÄùMake these frameworks your own: Don‚Äôt assume the way the framework is set up is the only way it can work. Tweak it to work for you and your company. Make your own decision-making framework that I could include in a future edition of this post! To help you evaluate these frameworks, and your decision-making process broadly, Brian Armstrong came up with a great set of attributes to aim for:Source: Brian ArmstrongKeep in mind as you work on your decision-making process, as Jeff Bezos said in his conversation with Lex Fridman, that ‚Äúhumans are social animals. Not truth-seeking animals. Important truths can be uncomfortable and make people defensive. Any high-functioning organization has to have mechanisms and a culture that supports truth-telling. You have to talk about that and how it takes energy.‚ÄùTo help you get to truth, here are my favorite (relatively lightweight) decision-making frameworks, in descending order from most structured to least.1. S.P.A.D.EThis popular framework, by Gokul Rajaram, finds a nice balance between structure and simplicity. It forces you to clarify the problem, identify roles, lay out timelines, and explore all possible alternatives, without making the process too rigid. Most importantly, it helps you avoid consensus thinking while also making sure that the person who makes the final decision is also accountable for the end result.‚ÄúA lot of forward-thinking companies practice consensus. Google is famous for it. But consensus is impractical and ineffective for one clear reason: consensus means no ownership. What is important isn‚Äôt that everyone agrees, it‚Äôs that everyone is listened to. And then the right person makes a decision, communicates it clearly, and rallies everyone around it.When I started at Square, the company surveyed employees about their number one frustration. They said decision-making. And I bet if you survey any company in the Valley, or even the country, you‚Äôd see similar answers. It‚Äôs not the decisions themselves employees are frustrated with, it‚Äôs the lack of transparency around how decisions are made. And employees crave transparency.A couple Square colleagues and I decided to come up with a new decision-making framework, an alternative to consensus built on accountability and clarity, where the person responsible for executing the decision would be the one who decides.‚Äù ‚ÄîGokul RajaramHere‚Äôs a template, instructions, and an example. This framework is best used when making a major decision, at the company or strategy level.2. Coinbase‚Äôs decision-making frameworkThis framework is very similar to S.P.A.D.E. but is more compact (everything fits inside a single Google Sheet) and includes some unique attributes, like allowing multiple deciders and giving the decision an expiration date. Since it‚Äôs so simple and compact, it can flex across most decisions.‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen it run from start to finish in under 15 minutes, live during a meeting, but it can also be used over multiple weeks for bigger decisions.The vast majority of decisions in a company are low-risk and should be made unilaterally by the owner of that area (e.g. should we move the standup meeting from Mon. to Tues. this week?).A decision-making framework is only needed when there is lack of clarity about a decision that is higher-risk. Higher risk can mean that the decision has long-term implications or that it can be costly to unwind if the wrong decision is made.‚Äù ‚ÄîBrian ArmstrongHere‚Äôs a template, and instructions for how to use it. This framework is best used when you need a framework that you can apply to both big and small decisions.3. Dory and PulseThis is a two-part meta-framework developed by Shishir Mehrotra (CEO of Coda) that dozens of companies have integrated into their daily workflows. It‚Äôs especially good at making sure everyone‚Äôs voice is heard, and flexing to all kinds of use-cases.‚ÄúI did some quick math, and in the past year I‚Äôve used Dory/Pulse over a thousand times. It‚Äôs a simple yet impactful ritual for supercharging decisions by equalizing voices and removing groupthink in meetings.I decided to catalog the many different ways I‚Äôve seen teams use Dory/Pulse. As I polled teams, this list quickly grew from a handful of variations to 14. You can see the full set in my post 14 ways to Dory/Pulse.In each case, a team was solving a slightly different problem and thus arrived at different solutions. For example: ¬†Teams scaling their company all-hands were drawn to techniques like Unbiased Dory and Anonymous DoryTeams focused on product/design proposal reviews invented Sentence Starter Dory and Pick an Option Pulse ¬†Teams struggling with hard prioritization choices landed on $100 Voting Pulse and Ranked Choice PulseTeams challenged with moving beyond ‚Äòmajority rules‚Äô consensus-driven decision-making landed on Role-centric Pulse and Conviction, Disagree, and Commit Pulseand so on...Many teams mix and match these techniques, so feel free to take a read and select the best parts for your specific situation.‚Äù‚ÄîShishir MehrotraHere are templates and instructions. This framework is best used when you are looking to make decisions in real time (i.e. during a meeting).4. RAPIDThis post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

Mission ‚Üí Vision ‚Üí Strategy ‚Üí Goals ‚Üí Roadmap ‚Üí Task

Each week I tackle reader questions about product, growth, career, and anything else that‚Äôs stressing you out about your work.SubscribeQ: How do strategy, vision, mission, goals, and roadmap all work together? Where should I start?First, some definitions:Mission: What are we trying to achieve?Vision: What does the world look like when we‚Äôve achieved it?Strategy: What‚Äôs our plan for achieving it, i.e. what‚Äôs our plan to win? Goals: How will we measure progress?Roadmap: What do we need to build in order to get there?Task: What‚Äôs one unit of work we can tackle next?Where should you start? Normally you start with your mission‚Äîwhy does your team (or company) even exist? What are you trying to achieve? What is your purpose?Some examples of great missions:Tesla: ‚ÄúAccelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy.‚ÄùTED: ‚ÄúSpread ideas.‚ÄùStripe: ‚ÄúIncrease the GDP of the internet.‚ÄùIKEA: ‚ÄúCreate a better everyday life for the many people.‚ÄùPatagonia: ‚ÄúUse business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis.‚ÄùSlack: ‚ÄúMake work life simpler, more pleasant, and more productive.‚ÄùGoogle: ‚ÄúOrganize the world‚Äôs information and make it universally accessible and useful.‚ÄùWorld Wildlife Fund: ‚ÄúConserve nature and reduce the most pressing threats to the diversity of life on Earth.‚ÄùNike: ‚ÄúDo everything possible to expand human potential.‚Äù Square: ‚ÄúMake commerce easy.‚ÄùVisionNext comes your vision: What does the world (or your product) look like when you‚Äôve achieved your mission?Some examples of great vision statements:Microsoft: ‚ÄúA computer on every desk and in every home.‚ÄùAlzheimer‚Äôs Association: ‚ÄúA world without Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.‚ÄùTeach for America: ‚ÄúOne day, all children in this nation will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education.‚ÄùTesla: ‚ÄúCreate the most compelling car company of the 21st century.‚ÄùLyft: ‚ÄúA world where cities feel small again. Where transportation and tech bring people together, instead of apart.‚ÄùNetflix: ‚ÄúBecome the best global entertainment distribution service.‚ÄùIf you start with your vision before your mission, that‚Äôs totally OK. Elon Musk likely started with a vision of the world he wanted to see and then developed his mission around that. No problem. Don‚Äôt overthink it.StrategyOnce you have your mission and vision, this is where strategy comes in. Your strategy is simply your plan to achieve your vision‚Äîyour plan to win.I‚Äôve written about getting better at strategy, and, to boil it down, a strategy is essentially a short description of your plan, with 3 to 5 concrete investments that, if you get right, will bring you closer to winning (i.e. achieving your vision). Here are some templates to help you frame your thinking.Here are some high-level examples of strategies:Tesla: Build a high-priced sports car ‚Üí Use that revenue to build an affordable car ‚Üí Use that revenue to build an even more affordable car ‚Üí While doing so, also provide zero-emission electric powerUber: Launch Uber Black ‚Üí Bring prices down by launching UberX ‚Üí Bring prices down by launching Uber Pool ‚Üí Bring prices down by launching scooters, bikes, etc.Substack: Build powerful publishing tools for writers ‚Üí Help writers become better writers through value-add services ‚Üí Grow their audience through network effectsAdditional examples of great real-life strategies:GitLab: Notice the clear mission, vision, and three-part strategy.Salesforce: Simple, but tells you exactly what needs to be done.Yahoo‚Äôs ‚Äúpeanut butter‚Äù memo: Notice how clearly this identifies the problem, and includes a three-part strategy. (Also, it‚Äôs obviously memorable since it‚Äôs now known as the ‚ÄúPeanut Butter Manifesto.‚Äù)Tesla: Notice the narrative style, the detailed identification of the problems, and the very simple, ambitious yet clear four-step strategy at the end.Teresa Torres‚Äôs opportunity solution tree framework is a great way to think through, and communicate, your strategy:GoalsNext, you can begin to define your goal. Goals are simply a way to measure the progress of your strategy toward achieving your ultimate vision.Some examples of visions and their associated goals:Microsoft: A computer on every desk and in every home ‚Üí X% of homes with a computerTeach for America: One day, all children in this nation will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education ‚Üí X% of children with educationAlzheimer‚Äôs Association: A world without Alzheimer‚Äôs disease ‚Üí X% decrease in Alzheimer‚Äôs casesHere‚Äôs my advice on setting goals and on choosing your North Star metric.RoadmapAnd finally, once you have your goals, you can align around and prioritize a roadmap. Here‚Äôs a template you can use.Within the roadmap, you break out individual tasks, the atomic unit of work for your teammates.Why do you need goals before you align around a roadmap and prioritize tasks? Because when prioritizing the many ideas your team has, you look at the ROI‚Äîthe effort vs. the impact. The impact you‚Äôre prioritizing against is based on how much you expect the project will impact your goals.That‚Äôs basically your plan as a product team, from the 10,000-foot mission to the day-to-day work of your team.As an example, here‚Äôs how it all fits together in the case of Tesla:And finally, let‚Äôs look at another ‚Äúreal-life‚Äù example:Mission ‚Üí Vision ‚Üí Strategy ‚Üí Goals ‚Üí Roadmap ‚Üí Task, as taught to us by Oceans ElevenMission: Rob the Bellagio, Mirage, and MGM Grand casinos, and get back at rival Terry BenedictThis post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

How Linear builds product - by Lenny Rachitsky

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeLinear is a story I‚Äôve been wanting to tell for a long time. Not only are they the #1 most requested startup for me to include in this series, they‚Äôre also building the product that a growing number of teams are using to build their own product. And they are doing so in incredibly unique ways:No product managers, just a head of product. PM duties are distributed across engineering and design.No durable cross-functional teams. Teams assemble around a project and  disperse once the project is done.No metrics-based goals. Just a North Star company-level metric goal.No A/B tests. Decisions are based on taste and opinions.Job candidates go through a paid work trial. They join the team for 1-5 days and work on a real project with the team.The team is completely remote. And always has been.Linear also has more cash in the bank than they‚Äôve ever raised in VC funding, they‚Äôve been profitable for 2+ years (before it was cool), and have spent a grand total of $35K on paid marketing in the history of the company. Only two people have ever left the company, and their CEO, Karri Saarinen, is a designer (who rarely gives interviews). For all of these reasons, I‚Äôm thrilled to share an in-depth look at how Linear builds product. If you‚Äôd like to learn more, check out Linear.app, find Karri on X, and they‚Äôre hiring!How Linear builds productKarri Saarinen, co-founder and CEO1. How far out do you plan in detail, and how has that evolved over the years?In the very beginning, when it was just us three founders, we planned by the week. We would think about the most important things to resolve and then go work on that. If you go back to the beginning of our changelog, you can see what shipped each week. Our goal was usually to figure out what was blocking us the most from getting more users on the product, and fixing things we heard from our beta users.Today, we have about 50 people at Linear. We only have a single product team, which means that we can keep the planning process quite centralized, and there is only one roadmap for the whole product. This makes it very clear to everyone what we are working on. Additionally, everyone feels responsible for the whole product and how it all works together.For the planning process itself, it‚Äôs a two-way approach, where we start with the founders and small leadership group to plan the direction we want to go as a company for the following 12 months. In parallel, we ask everyone on the team to share their thoughts and ideas in FigJam sessions (here‚Äôs a link to our template) or surveys to get more thoughts on areas we could improve or tackle.FigJam session template for annual planningOnce we have the strategy in mind, we then define a high-level roadmap for the next half of the year based on that. The strategy, for example, might be ‚Äúfocusing on large company needs.‚Äù We don‚Äôt have complicated ways to rank or vote on projects. Instead, we believe that if the leadership team and the whole company spend time with customers and use the product regularly, the needs and opportunities become more apparent. Then it‚Äôs just a matter of sequencing and scoping.We‚Äôve included a high-level product roadmap for Q2 and Q3 of this year below. We had two strategic workstreams: planning and roadmapping, and issue discovery. Our other two workstreams are dedicated to high-priority user asks, so we can respond quickly to needs we hear from customers, and keep-the-lights-on projects (in the ‚Äúother‚Äù workstream below). We‚Äôll include new features and functionality alongside improvements to existing features within these workstreams. We try to plan out in detail for two quarters, then sketch out the next half, and leave a pretty extensive backlog to pull from. The roadmap (more on that below) for a given workstream will get more detailed as we break this work into projects.High-level product roadmapWe sequence the projects based on what we think is the optimal path to tackle them. ‚ÄúOptimal path‚Äù means we see a reason to do X before Y, because they would support each other, or we have specific people from the team in mind who should tackle some specific project but cannot do them in parallel. We like to pair projects with individual strengths when possible. For example, when we know the project feature will need a more advanced front end, we staff with our strongest front-end people.¬†¬†Project plans start as documents or lists where we just draft ideas. We then ask the project team to write the spec for the project. Here‚Äôs an example spec for our Triage feature:After the spec is written, we‚Äôll add the project to the Roadmap in Linear. This is our internal working view of the ‚ÄúPlanning & Roadmapping‚Äù workstream and how the team manages their workflow as they build.Roadmap for ‚ÄúPlanning & Roadmapping‚Äù features2. How many PMs do you have?One. We hired Nan Yu a little over a year ago when we were about 25 people. He is Head of Product and currently the only one carrying a ‚ÄúPM‚Äù title. The reason I phrase it this way is that we have other roles that also contribute to what is traditionally considered part of the PM role.Our plan is not to hire PMs for every project or team. We hired Nan because we saw the need for someone to shepherd the product overall and the activities around building products. Instead of having a PM for every team or area of the product, we like to see that the broader team collectively thinks about the product and how features are delivered, not just the PMs.3. Do you use OKRs in some form?We haven‚Äôt used OKRs. For goals, we like to keep it simple and sometimes have more strategic goals, like ‚ÄúBe the default tool for startups‚Äù or ‚ÄúGet xxx number of companies,‚Äù which we then use as the theme for figuring out the roadmap. I find these types of goals useful to align our team to what we are after without being too specific about how we get there. It‚Äôs also much more empowering for them.Our very secret strategy slideWe also don‚Äôt have metrics goals for the product or any projects, but we do have a North Star company-level metric goal. For a B2B tool like ours that takes some time for a company to adopt the tool or any new feature, setting specific metrics goals and measuring progress doesn‚Äôt seem that useful and more often can lead you astray. To me, product goals should be about how we add value for our existing customers or expand to a new customer base; in other words, how we solve our customers‚Äô problems better.With certain projects, we might pull up specific data or metrics to see if the data gives us any more insights, but it‚Äôs not the way we make decisions. We don‚Äôt do A/B tests. We validate ideas and assumptions that are driven by taste and opinions, rather than the other way around where tests drive decisions. There is no specific engagement or other number we look at. We beta test, see the feedback, iterate, and eventually we have the conviction that the change or feature is as good as it can be at this point and we should release it to see how it works at scale.4. Do you structure your teams around products, user types, user journeys, outcomes, or something in between? Has this changed over the years?We only have mobile and infrastructure as specialized teams, as they require specialized skills and focus. The rest of the product team works on the projects that come out of the planning process, which could address any area of the product. We have purposely avoided product-area-specific teams (e.g. the roadmaps product team, the cycles product team, etc.), as I see it can be a way for people to get too trapped in their specific product area and potentially lose the broader context and/or start working on more minor details with diminishing returns. Naturally, some people become more knowledgeable about some parts or types of problems, and the same people might address the same area again, but it‚Äôs not a formal position.Our product team is divided by region (U.S. and Europe). We realized early on that it‚Äôs challenging to work over many different time zones with a distributed team, so we now have Europe- and U.S.-based people run as their own distinct groups. In addition, we have people in marketing, data, sales, customer success, support, and talent/people who work closely with our product teams.¬†When we do our roadmap planning, we divide the work between the U.S.- and Europe-based teams. Then within those teams, the projects get staffed with a project lead and the rest of the team. The project lead can be an engineer or designer or whoever else is part of the project. Since we don‚Äôt have any PMs other than our Head of Product, the project lead is never a PM. The role of the lead is to get the project started and communicate how it‚Äôs going. Typically, for almost any feature we build, we have small teams of one designer and two engineers. At our current size, we have about six project teams running in parallel. Once the team finishes their project, they disperse and move to another project.When it comes to planning, we might set up themes around a certain type of customer, area, or type of features that we would like to develop, but we just don‚Äôt set the org chart based on that.5. How do your product/design review meetings work?We aim to give individual project teams ownership of projects, because we believe that when a team has ownership over their work, they can create far better solutions for our users.I, along with my co-founders Jori Lallo and Tuomas Artman and our Head of Product, each lead or sit in each project meeting acting as a sponsor to give feedback and direction as needed. One of us is ultimately responsible for the outcome. For example, we have a project team focused on new-user onboarding experience, and Jori will lead that project and the project team meetings, while also providing feedback on updates shared asynchronously from the project team in Slack.We don‚Äôt have formal product or design reviews. It‚Äôs more ad hoc and iterative, which enables us to move faster. For example, our designers share an early design in a project-related Slack group and get informal asynchronous feedback from many different people that way.¬†We‚Äôve had a robust feature-flag system from the beginning, so we push new features to internal testing as fast as possible, sometimes in days or weeks from starting the project. At that point, everyone can try out the feature and see if something feels wrong or if they have ideas for how things could be improved. Because of these feature flags, there is no excuse to wait to ship.We run a beta customer testing program called Linear Origins where our customers get earlier access to new features and we can get product feedback early. Sometimes this happens a month or two before we aim to launch a feature, and sometimes it happens days before. For example, we‚Äôre working on a more significant new feature release and we‚Äôre setting up calls with some of our customers to walk them through the product. If they‚Äôre interested in trying it out, we‚Äôll enable the new feature, ask them for their feedback, and do our best to address it. While we do this with some products, we don‚Äôt view pushing features to beta as a required step to launching. We still value shipping quickly, which means not everything needs to go through the beta program, but we use it when we find it useful to get more feedback.6. Are product and design part of the same org? And who do PMs ultimately report to? Has this changed over the years?Yes, product, engineering, and design are all part of the product team. Product and design report to me (CEO). We have engineering managers, but engineering ultimately reports up to my co-founders: Tuomas for infrastructure and Europe engineering, and Jori for U.S. engineering. While engineering and design have their own meetings for their functions, for the most part, we talk about ‚ÄúProduct‚Äù holistically and not engineering, design, and product separately. The org has stayed the same from the beginning.¬†7. What‚Äôs your primary tool for task management, and bug tracking?Well, Linear, of course. We recently shared a blog post about how we use Linear to manage incoming bug reports and feature requests directly from customers.¬†¬†As a quick overview, for bug tracking we heavily use our Triage feature, which is like an inbox for your team. Our support team, sales team, and even I often file issues into Triage, and one of our ‚Äúgoalie‚Äù engineers routes the request to the appropriate person or fixes it at the time. ‚ÄúGoalie‚Äù is a weekly rotation where an engineer helps the support team with issues, fixes bugs, and triages incoming requests.Most of the other tasks are part of projects. The engineers and designers are creating the tasks for themselves and resolving them as they go about the project. Project teams do weekly updates on the project progress using our Project Updates features. These updates also get posted to Slack to our #product-updates channel so anyone can follow them.8. You built one of the most beloved and successful products out there today. What would you say is unique or central to your approach to product that leads to such a successful product?One of the unique aspects to Linear is that we expect the project team to be the PM.This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

Introducing DRICE: A modern prioritization framework

























Lenny's NewsletterSubscribeSign inShare this postIntroducing DRICE: a modern prioritization frameworkwww.lennysnewsletter.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOtherIntroducing DRICE: a modern prioritization frameworkBoost your experiment win rate and help your team drive more impactDarius C and Alexey KomissaroukNov 07, 2023‚àô Paid208Share this postIntroducing DRICE: a modern prioritization frameworkwww.lennysnewsletter.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOther3Shareüëã Hey, I‚Äôm Lenny and welcome to a¬†üîí subscriber-only edition üîí¬†of my weekly newsletter. Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeIf you boil down a product manager‚Äôs job to just one task, it‚Äôs making sure everyone on your team knows what to do next‚Äîand that it‚Äôs the most impactful work they can be doing.In other words, prioritizing.If you can get better at prioritizing,¬†you can grow your leverage as a product leader, and increase the impact you and your team drive. And while you can‚Äôt double the speed that engineers build at or designers design at, by picking better projects even a little bit better, you can double your team‚Äôs impact.Below, Darius Contractor and Alexey Komissarouk share a brand-new framework that will make you significantly better at prioritizing. They also include plug-and-play templates, real-life case studies, and great memes. I wish I had this years ago.Darius Contractor¬†is the former head of growth at Dropbox, Facebook, Airtable, and Vendr and is currently Chief Growth Officer at¬†Otter.ai. You can find him on X, LinkedIn, and Darius.com. Alexey Komissarouk, a former growth engineering lead at MasterClass and Opendoor, is currently writing a book and advising teams on growth engineering. You can find him on X, LinkedIn, and alexeymk.com. Alexey will be¬†speaking about growth engineering at Reforge this Thursday.With limited time and resources, what is the highest-value thing a product manager can do for their team? ¬†Prioritization. Ruthless, rigorous prioritization.The guide below contains everything you need to run a reliable prioritization process. It‚Äôs based on a distillation of techniques from the authors‚Äô combined 35-plus years of experience driving growth at Dropbox, Facebook, Airtable, Opendoor, and MasterClass that, in our experience, doubled our impact rate.The frameworks are primarily intended for growth teams, but the practices apply to any team focused on moving a business metric. This prioritization process should be run every planning cycle.Below, we‚Äôll walk you through:The industry-standard prioritization process RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)Then we‚Äôll refine the top ideas using ‚ÄúDRICE‚Äù (Detailed RICE)Finally, we‚Äôll talk through how to make the most of these two frameworksThroughout this guide, we‚Äôll assume you‚Äôve already collected tons of potential ideas‚Äîthrough brainstorming, sifting through data, looking at sales/CX calls, your past backlogs, etc. As a rule of thumb, you‚Äôll want to have at least 5x as many ideas as you could reasonably build in the next time period (typically a quarter) before starting to prioritize. Part 1: RICEDefinitionIn short, RICE-ing is the process of T-shirt scoring (i.e. S/M/L) your ideas according to their:Reach: How many of your customers would experience the new ideaImpact: If the idea pans out, how much it would affect conversionConfidence: How likely it is to workEffort: How much time it would take to validate (from the engineering team)The process is best illustrated by example.Example: ‚ÄúCheckout with PayPal‚Äù vs. ‚Äúfree-trial promo codes‚ÄùSay your team is choosing between two potential ideas:Checkout with PayPal. Several potential customers have emailed complaining that they will only buy with PayPal.Free-trial promo code. Your podcast marketing manager wants to be able to give away promo codes for an ‚ÄúX-day free trial.‚ÄùWe can compare the ideas based on their qualities:Checkout with PayPal:Reach: all. Potential customers must go through checkout and are exposed to the option.Impact: small. Most customers are comfortable with credit cards.Confidence: likely. Competitors offer PayPal; customers have asked for it before.Effort: medium. Will need to integrate PayPal through the Braintree API.On the other hand, a free-trial promo code is:Low-reaching: Only about 15% of your customers come in through podcasts.Medium-level confidence: Free-trial promos are common but not ubiquitous.High impact: The company has had free trials convert well in past tests.High effort: The free-trial code is messy; the team will need a month to clean it up.In visual terms:Eyeballing would suggest we‚Äôre better off with Checkout with PayPal. Even though the potential impact isn‚Äôt as high, the change is likelier to work, faster to implement, and will affect more potential customers.ProcessesThe process above works well with two ideas, but what if we have tens of ideas to score and rank? A spreadsheet keeps things organized. Here‚Äôs a minimalistic template from Alexey, and a batteries-included Airtable template (called EVELYN) from Darius.¬†Sizing heuristics¬†It‚Äôs not always obvious exactly what ‚Äúhigh impact‚Äù versus ‚Äúmedium impact‚Äù means.¬†At this stage, these estimates are meant to be low-fidelity and directional SWAGs anyway. Rather than nailing the categories, compare between items‚Äîdo all the M‚Äôs truly feel smaller than the L‚Äôs?That said, here are some heuristics for evaluating an idea at this stage.Reach is relatively straightforward to estimate: either your users will experience the change or they won‚Äôt. Effort estimates come with experience on the engineering side.¬†Always strive to run the laziest test possible, asking ‚ÄúWhat is the least amount of engineering work required to test this idea?‚Äù¬†Impact and Confidence have more subtlety, however.ImpactAn idea should be higher-impact if:It addresses a sensitive-to-change portion of the customer journey: above the fold on the landing page, pricing, etc.The change is particularly significant‚Äîa ‚Äúbig swing‚ÄùConfidenceAn idea should be higher-confidence if:You‚Äôve already had the same concept work elsewhere: ‚ÄúEmphasizing the money-back guarantee was a winner on the homepage; let‚Äôs try it during checkout.‚ÄùOne or more of your competitors already employ this tactic (they‚Äôve likely tested into it): ‚ÄúOur competitors offer a monthly pricing plan; we should try the same.‚ÄùYour customers are explicitly and repeatedly complaining about it: ‚ÄúWhy do I have to create a new account? I wish I could log in with Google.‚ÄùThe product manager should have the context to fill in Impact, Confidence, and Reach. The Effort column can sometimes be filled by an experienced product manager, but more commonly a tech lead.Once a T-shirt-size prioritization is complete, you can sort the list based on the implied score (with T-shirt sizes translated to numeric values to make the math work):Score = (Reach % * Impact % * Confidence likelihood %) / Weeks of effortSort all of the available ideas using their scores. Take about twice as many ideas as you‚Äôd have time for during the period you‚Äôre planning for (typically a quarter). This is your preliminary shortlist.Validating your shortlistSome shortlisted ideas will surprise you. RICE isn‚Äôt gospel; double-check and adjust the suspicious scores until you feel comfortable. Next, loop in your team, who will appreciate a chance to weigh in and offer helpful adjustments.Even after the refinements, some ideas you had thought of as clunkers will end up above your favorites. This is the process working as intended. By establishing objective evaluation criteria, you have separated the wheat from the chaff.Part 2: DRICEOnce your RICEd shortlist is ready, it‚Äôs time to invest in a higher-fidelity evaluation of your ideas. This assessment method is known as DRICE, a ‚ÄúDetailed RICE‚Äù estimate.During DRICE, we will go from:A 30-second estimate to a 30-minute estimateA relative scoring (S/M/L) to a $X of expected annualized revenue‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be cool if‚Äù to ‚ÄúWe are shovel-ready‚Äù‚ÄúWait, 30 minutes per idea?‚Äù says the growth PM reading this guide. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time for this. Our list is solid. Let‚Äôs be biased toward action and get started!‚ÄùNot so fast.Teams that adopt DRICE notice a difference in the projects they end up prioritizing. Many ‚Äúpromising‚Äù projects turn out to be defeated by a half-hour investigation, while ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù features that would have been left on the cutting-room floor end up becoming high-ROI winners.Dropbox case studyA particularly clear example of this comes from Darius‚Äôs time at Dropbox, focused on activating new Dropbox Business users. One proposed idea was a migration tool for Basic users, streamlining the process of getting¬†started with a Business account. Initially we didn‚Äôt think this would be a huge win, since target users were only a subset of all sign-ups.However, the DRICE investigation showed:A large percentage of Business team creators were previously Basic users¬†A good chunk of teams had multiple usersMany teams had private files but not team filesA ‚Äúchoose folders to share with your team‚Äù modal could boost sharing significantlyThe DRICE investigation significantly bumped the idea‚Äôs expected ROI. We built it. The Dropbox Business Migration Tool became the biggest activation win of the quarter. Without DRICE, we were unlikely to have prioritized it at all.Overall, we found that Dropbox teams that adopted DRICE were able to move their key metric by twice as much as teams that stuck to a simpler prioritization process.¬†To see how the DRICE process works, it‚Äôs also best illustrated by example.Example DRICE: Adding PayPalWe‚Äôve already RICEd the PayPal project:Reach: all. Potential customers must go through checkout and are exposed to the option.Impact: small. Most customers are comfortable with credit cards.Confidence: likely. Competitors offer PayPal; customers have asked for it before.Effort: medium. Will need to integrate PayPal through the Braintree API.Not bad. Here‚Äôs what a DRICE would look like:HypothesisA potential customer segment prefers to pay with PayPal instead of credit cards and has been emailing to let us know. By adding PayPal as an option in the checkout flow, we will improve conversion by 2.7%, or an incremental $540k/year.Impact estimateEngineering estimate¬†Effort: 7 daysWe originally thought we‚Äôd have to integrate the Braintree API, but these days, you can integrate PayPal directly from Stripe. This eliminates the bulk of the expected back-end work, leaving us:[1 day] Integrate PayPal button on front end according to designs[1 day] Update receipt emails to support PayPal[1 day] Migrate e-commerce back end to support a new payment type from Stripe[2 days] Integration tests for key flows (purchase, refund, cancellation, chargeback)¬†[2 days] Buffer timeReturn on eng investment$540k in annual revenueEng cost of 7 days (~1.5 weeks), yielding an ROI of¬†$360k/eng weekThrough a DRICE estimate, we reduced the engineering estimate and increased the success likelihood for our ‚ÄúCheckout with PayPal‚Äù idea. With 30 minutes from PM and engineering, we‚Äôve taken the idea from being marginal to a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs definitely do it this quarter‚Äù type of idea. Note that we didn‚Äôt eliminate guesswork as part of this process; our guesses simply became educated.Here‚Äôs a DRICE template to use when making your own estimates.Components of a DRICE estimateNow that we‚Äôve walked through an example, let‚Äôs talk about what a DRICE involves and how to perform one. You‚Äôll want:HypothesisA clear, brief explanation of the idea that anybody without context will be able to understand, and a short justification for why you believe the idea will be effective.Impact estimateThis post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

The ultimate guide to willingness-to-pay

























Lenny's NewsletterSubscribeSign inShare this postThe ultimate guide to willingness-to-paywww.lennysnewsletter.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOtherThe ultimate guide to willingness-to-payHow to effectively run your own WTP study, with templates, guides, examples, and moreKristen BermanFeb 13, 2024‚àô Paid155Share this postThe ultimate guide to willingness-to-paywww.lennysnewsletter.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOther6Shareüëã Hey, I‚Äôm Lenny and welcome to a¬†üîí subscriber-only edition üîí¬†of my weekly newsletter. Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeP.S. Don‚Äôt miss The Best of Lenny‚Äôs Newsletter book (all proceeds going to charity), Lennybot (an AI chatbot trained on my newsletter posts, podcast interviews, and more), my recruiting service (focusing on Sr. PM and VP roles), and my new swag store (great gifts for your favorite PM, or yourself!).Q: How do I figure out how to price my product? Pricing is the most under-leveraged growth lever. It can drive enormous sustained growth (quickly) and often takes very little product work, yet is rarely prioritized or even discussed within product teams. That‚Äôs because pricing can be scary, irrational, and hard to know if you‚Äôve done it right. Yet everyone who invests in pricing wishes they‚Äôd done it a lot sooner.Enter my friend Kristen Berman. Kristen is a behavioral scientist, a founder of Irrational Labs, and a past podcast guest and newsletter collaborator. For a decade, she‚Äôs worked closely with tech companies to drive behavior change. She leverages the latest behavioral-science research to¬†improve¬†products‚Äô¬†conversion, engagement, and, most impactfully, pricing. Just in the past few years, she‚Äôs helped dozens of companies revamp their pricing strategy‚Äîwith tremendous results. Below, based on her work and the latest research, Kristen shares the most in-depth and actionable guide I‚Äôve come across on how to execute a pricing study (spoiler alert: there is way more than Van Westendorp). She also provides two mega qualitative and quantitative templates for you to use in your own pricing research. This advice is meaty and actionable, and will help any product leader on the hunt for new growth levers.For more from Kristen, you can reach out to her here if you want to chat about pricing, watch her weekly teardowns on Substack, and subscribe to the Irrational Labs newsletter.Pricing is one of the biggest levers to growth. Why are so few product teams testing their pricing?At Irrational Labs, we surveyed 60 software companies to reflect on their experience with pricing studies. Of them, 50% said their companies have never run pricing studies, and only 25% reported even A/B testing a pricing change. Larger firms often have dedicated staff for pricing strategy yet are still generally reluctant to change the status quo.Why do so few companies run pricing studies? Based on our work with dozens of top companies, we primarily hear: It‚Äôs too risky. What if we annoy users? Reddit‚Äôs users flipped out. Strava had bumps. Patreon got blowback.It‚Äôs technically complex. Testing multiple prices in the market for SaaS products also means maintaining them‚Äîwhich no technical team wants to do indefinitely.Willingness-to-pay (WTP) studies are just hard to run. Recruiting participants, writing the study, and analyzing data requires lead time and some expertise. It can be intimidating.¬†¬†These are legitimate reasons. However, the potential revenue gains from effective pricing often outweigh them. A McKinsey analysis suggests that a 1% improvement in your pricing can increase your profits by up to 11%.So if you do decide to change your prices, how should you go about it? This article will decode the four most commonly used quantitative WTP methods and provide a template of questions you can use.¬†Quant is very important, but it can be even more powerful paired with qualitative work. Likewise, we also included a robust qualitative research guide, focused on helping B2B companies with pricing. While the optimal recipe is to do both qual and quant, anything is better than doing nothing. As pricing expert Madhavan Ramanujam says on Lenny‚Äôs Podcast, ‚ÄúTalk to at least one person. Most companies are not even doing that.‚Äù Willingness-to-pay methods: The rundownThe top four commonly used quantitative methods are: Van WestendorpBecker-DeGroot-MarschakMultiple price listDiscrete choice or choice-basedUntil recently, these methods were difficult to compare‚Äîthe most frequently cited studies were published around 20 years ago. This changed in 2023, when Randy Gao, Simon Huang, and Minah Jung comprehensively reviewed the top methods, combining insights from dozens of papers to make sense of WTP. Their analysis builds on a compelling 2019 WTP field study and an in-depth comparison from 2011.Below, I‚Äôll run through the different methods and pros and cons. Every research method has trade-offs, and part of being able to trust your final results is understanding these nuances. At the end of the post, I‚Äôll share six tips for implementing these surveys yourself, along with two mega templates to help guide you.But first, a big disclaimer: Most of the below methods hold the product description constant while trying to determine some magical number that people will pay. But as pricing experts will tell you, this number, i.e. the price, is just part of the story. In reality, your product‚Äôs description and features, as well as what it‚Äôs compared to1, play a role in WTP.Stories can add measurable value to seemingly worthless items. Someone paid $51 for this yellow bear figure. Why? The story makes it feel scarce.Pasta that is described as ‚Äúsauceable‚Äù commands an 80% higher price. Why? The adjective implies quality. If the marketing team asked customers, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the most you‚Äôd pay for pasta?,‚Äù ‚Äúsauceability‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt factor in‚Äîand the results would be off.How much would you pay for a virtual whiteboard? Probably not $960 a year. Yet ‚Äúthe visual workspace for innovation‚Äù Miro charges $80 a month for a team of 10 people. Clearly, they‚Äôve figured out positioning.Assuming that price is a ‚Äúmagic number‚Äù implies that people have predetermined their willingness to pay for your product; they have a number in their head. But in reality, most of your customers haven‚Äôt thought much about it. They are deciding in real time what they‚Äôre willing to pay based on the information they have about the product. As a product manager, marketer, or designer, you decide what that information is. In other words, customers aren‚Äôt walking in with an unmovable POV‚Äîyou shape their POV.¬†You have two levers to do this: (1) change your prices and (2) change your positioning. The latter starts long before customers reach your pricing page‚Äìbut once they‚Äôre there, the impact of your copy, descriptions, and choice architecture on conversions can‚Äôt be overstated.Let‚Äôs suppose you‚Äôre looking at changing prices and want to know what your customers are willing to pay. In that case, a quantitative pricing study is your best bet.So what are the methods to determine WTP?1. The Van Westendorp¬†If you‚Äôve heard about pricing studies, you‚Äôve likely heard of the Van Westendorp (VW) method (sometimes called price sensitivity meter, or PSM). But despite being the favored child in popular tech posts, it‚Äôs not a fully reputable method.¬†First, not many companies are actually using it. Of the 60 software companies we surveyed, only eight said they used it. And academics don‚Äôt use it either. The top VW study on Google Scholar has 36 citings (a low number) and was run on university students measuring their WTP for private dormitories. (Aren‚Äôt we through with using college students for psychology papers?) The other methods mentioned in this article have citings in the hundreds and thousands. Perhaps most damningly, it was invented in the 1970s. Given the advancement of data science and research methods, surveys are not like fine wine‚Äîthey don‚Äôt age well.Why do people like it? The pros: The method itself is pretty simple. You ask people four questions to find out the lowest and highest price they‚Äôre willing to pay for something:At what price would it be so low that you would start to question this product‚Äôs quality?At what price do you think this product is starting to be a bargain?At what price does this product begin to seem expensive?At what price is this product too expensive?Participants typically respond to an open-ended question (empty text box). This is called the open-ended, or ‚Äúdirect,‚Äù approach in the literature. In this method, you‚Äôll get what people want to pay instead of what they might pay.The questions are straightforward‚Äîand there are only four. Win. And the continuous format, without a scale consisting of set intervals, gives detailed information on individual variation. This makes responses easy to analyze.However, the Van Westendorp method has a big problem: the well-documented phenomenon known as hypothetical bias. Gao et al. sum up the issue in their recent paper: ‚ÄúUnder hypothetical settings, people state a higher valuation than their actual valuations.‚ÄùWhat does this look like? John List, a University of Chicago professor and Walmart‚Äôs first chief economist, ran a donation study‚Äîthe real treatment raised $310 for their cause, whereas more than twice that ($780) was pledged in the hypothetical.We‚Äôre asking people to imagine a fake world and tell us what they would do in it. Sadly, we‚Äôre bad at predicting our future self‚Äôs actions. In a fake world, we have no competing priorities, we‚Äôre very rich, and we like lots of things2‚Äînot an ideal scenario for figuring out WTP.Should you use the Van Westendorp? We say proceed with caution, unless you‚Äôre including questions that reduce hypothetical bias (see this guide for examples) and you‚Äôre focusing on more established product categories (versus products that are brand-new to the world).2. The Becker-DeGroot-MarschakTo overcome the hypothetical bias associated with Van Westendorp, economists have developed ‚Äúincentive-compatible‚Äù pricing methods. These methods give you an incentive to report what you would really pay (or rather, a disincentive for answering hastily or intentionally misreporting your willingness to pay). The goal is to more accurately gauge people‚Äôs true willingness to pay.The Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) is arguably the most-used method in experimental economics. While it‚Äôs very similar to the Van Westendorp, it adds an important twist: it tries to eliminate cheap talk.¬†In the study‚Äôs original design, participants are asked to write down the maximum amount they‚Äôd pay for an item. Then a random number is selected. If the participant‚Äôs written amount is higher than this random number, they must purchase the item at the random number‚Äôs price. However, if their amount is lower, they cannot buy the item and they owe nothing.This is important because, when answering, people think they may have to pay for the thing. There is skin in the game.¬†They don‚Äôt know the selling price in advance, so overstating might lead to paying more than their actual valuation‚Äîand understating might result in missing the opportunity to buy at a price they would have accepted.This seemed to have removed most of the hypothetical bias3 that‚Äôs made the Van Westendorp method contentious. A semi-recent study looked at the sale of water filters to families in Ghana and found BDM had predictive power on demand, when compared with the straight sale of the filter.¬†Problem solved? Not quite. Critics point out that the method‚Äôs core mechanism, which involves a ‚Äúrandom number‚Äù scheme for aligning incentives, is complicated. Be honest. Did you really understand how this worked from the above explanation? Many participants don‚Äôt either.¬†3. Multiple price list (or Gabor-Granger)To recap: Becker-DeGroot-Marschak improved on the Van Westendorp method a little by ‚Äúadding teeth‚Äù to the questions. But BDM can be hard to understand.¬†Another problem with the BDM method is that it asks people to name their price‚Äîto be price givers.¬†This assumes we have a predetermined number in our heads. It‚Äôs as if we expected our customers to always be thinking deeply about our product, just waiting for us to ask them how much they‚Äôd pay.¬†¬†In reality, though, we‚Äôre price takers: we go to a website and it tells us the price.The multiple price list method (MPL) was developed to address this. In the BDM, respondents must state a maximum WTP (price giving). In MPL, on the other hand, the respondents must say yes or no to a list of prices (price taking).¬†¬†Visual from Gao and Huang‚Äôs paper of MPLDo you want to purchase this for $35? $45? $55? This lets you simplify the incentive-compatible element, because the researcher just tells the study participant: ‚ÄúOne of your choices will be randomly selected and we will implement it. For instance, if you select $45 and you say yes to the $45 price point, you will have to buy it. If you say no to $45, you cannot buy it.‚ÄùSo from an empirical perspective, is MPL better than BDM?¬†¬†Historically, researchers have recommended MPL over BDM‚Äîmainly because it‚Äôs simpler and more transparent. This has led economists to use it widely.4But new research points to some potential flaws. Gao et al.‚Äôs latest paper implies that the MPL method may mislead researchers to underestimate the value of their products. They run 10 experiments and show that the MPL method ‚Äúactually leads to systematically lower WTP estimates.‚Äù This could lead researchers and marketers to underprice their products and leave money on the table.¬†Why? Possibly, getting people to pay attention to each value (yes/no) puts the focus on the opportunity cost of money‚Äîand this may decrease people‚Äôs willingness to spend it.4. Discrete-choice-basedThis last pricing survey method is fundamentally different. In the VW, BDM, and MPL methods, we ask people to decide about one product. In contrast, discrete choice involves giving people multiple product options with slightly different features and prices and asking them to pick one they would buy. Basically, you replicate whatever you intend to launch and describe it just as you would on your marketing page.¬†Silvia Frucci, a go-to-market leader at Optum, endorses this method:‚ÄúWe used the choice-based pricing method at Optum. To figure out WTP for a new product, we asked questions along the lines of Which of the three products are you most inclined to purchase? The study asked this question five different times with a variation of feature and pricing combinations. Our sample was representative to our target; it went out to 12 provider practices via phone-based interviews.The results had a really profound impact on our business. Based on this study, we found out the WTP for the product was lower than we assumed and adoption would be more difficult. Based on the survey insights, we ended up killing the full product that we were about to launch! Instead, we integrated the high-value parts into other existing businesses and products.‚ÄùJohn List also endorses the discrete choice method: ‚ÄúI would say when I cannot obtain revealed preference data, I would follow this approach to estimate marginal values.‚Äù¬†Why does he like it? It leverages relativity. We can‚Äôt assume that responses to a survey reflect absolute willingness to pay. But we can infer relative willingness to pay, and that comes closer to how we make real-world decisions: this or that?¬†You can design it simply, with a couple of straightforward options:List and team sent out mailers to collect donations. They used this question to test the choice-based method and to measure which option people wanted.Alternatively, you can ask the question six or seven different times and vary attributes. Here‚Äôs an example question using the discrete-choice-based experiment method for a random product:Imagine you‚Äôre considering purchasing new and innovative enterprise software that can do the following:Project management software that costs $8/month per user and can automate quarterly headcount planning¬†Project management software that costs $11/month per user and can automate quarterly headcount planning and provide what-if scenario planning¬†Project management software that costs $12/month per user and can provide what-if scenario planning and real-time headcount planning¬†Would not purchasePlease click around on the landing page and explore what these products can do. Then select the option that you would be most likely to purchase. At the end, we will choose 20% of the people who take this survey and sell them the product at the price they choose. Make sure to choose the product you would actually spend money on!As with the other methods, we need to add incentive alignment to avoid cheap talk. In this method, it‚Äôs a bit easier. You can say a few people will be chosen at random to receive the option they choose.¬†If you‚Äôre familiar with conjoint analysis, you might rightly ask: Isn‚Äôt this just that? Yep. This is one type of conjoint. Qualtrics says it‚Äôs the simplest and most common. Full conjoints focus more on individual attribute trade-offs and ranking (which can be less ‚Äúreal world‚Äù), versus complete product choices. They also tend to be longer studies‚Äîwhich risks causing decision fatigue for participants. Maybe more damningly, they can be time-consuming to set up and hard to get right, and thus more expensive.¬†Discrete-choice-based studies are an art and a science. To avoid a long questionnaire, you‚Äôll need to make some strategic choices on product bundles. And you need a statistical package you can use to analyze data. SurveyMonkey has strong examples of this on their blog (scroll down). Qualtrics (which Irrational Labs uses) has survey design packages. There‚Äôs also Conjointly.¬†¬†Which WTP method should you use?¬†This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

What to do if your product isn‚Äôt taking off

























Lenny's NewsletterSubscribeSign inShare this postWhat to do if your product isn‚Äôt taking offwww.lennysnewsletter.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOtherWhat to do if your product isn‚Äôt taking offSeven steps you can take today to try to turn things aroundLenny RachitskyJan 09, 2024‚àô Paid266Share this postWhat to do if your product isn‚Äôt taking offwww.lennysnewsletter.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOther4Shareüëã Hey, I‚Äôm Lenny and welcome to a¬†üîí subscriber-only edition üîí¬†of my weekly newsletter. Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeP.S. New swag dropQ: I‚Äôve been working on my startup for a couple of years now. What are my options if my product isn‚Äôt taking off?First of all, I‚Äôm sorry. Spending years of your life on an idea that isn‚Äôt clicking‚Äîthe long hours, the stress, your reputation on the line, and not seeing the fruit of all that labor‚Äîit sucks. Especially while everyone around you is seemingly killing it.Most startups, and new product ideas, fail‚Äîwe all know this‚Äîbut it‚Äôs different when it‚Äôs your product.If it‚Äôs any consolation, this is going to be happening to a lot of startups in the coming months:Source: Elad Gil on XTo help you make it through the darkness, here‚Äôs a series of concrete actions you can take today to try to turn things around:Talk to more users (actually do it)Change your target audience/ICPChange your positioning/messaging/pitchTry a ‚Äúkickstarter‚Äù to get the word outFind something that is working and pivot fully to thatGive it a bit more timeGive up and move onRemember, many product builders have gone through what you‚Äôre going through now and have found a way. You can too.1. Talk to more users (actually do it)This tweet from Tomer London (CPO of Gusto) sums it up:Gustaf Alstr√∂mer, a Group Partner at Y Combinator, shared this same advice during our chat after I asked him why most startups fail:‚ÄúIf I drill down what makes companies fail, it‚Äôs quite simple: They don‚Äôt talk to users, which means they don‚Äôt find product-market fit. And if they don‚Äôt find product-market fit, nothing else really matters. This is the mistake most people make. It‚Äôs all about talking to customers and learning that you‚Äôre building something that‚Äôs actually useful. YC‚Äôs headline is ‚ÄòMake things people want,‚Äô and it‚Äôs still true and it‚Äôs always going to be true.‚ÄùAlso:I know you‚Äôve heard this advice before, and you‚Äôre probably doing it, but if you‚Äôre not, make it a point to talk to 5 to 10 potential customers this week. If you already are, that‚Äôs great.When talking to people, look for two things: pain and pull. Pain tells you there‚Äôs an opportunity to solve a problem. Pull tells you that you‚Äôre actually solving the problem.Here‚Äôs what pain and pull look like in practice:People pay you money: Several people start to (or offer to) pay for your early product, ideally people you don‚Äôt have a direct connection to.Strong emotion: You‚Äôre hearing hatred for the incumbents (i.e. pain) or a deep and strong emotional reaction to your idea (i.e. pull).Cold inbound interest: You‚Äôre seeing cold inbound interest in your product.Continued usage: If you‚Äôve got a prototype running, people continue to use your product even if it‚Äôs bad.When I was building my startup Localmind, we were talking to users all the time, and people constantly told us they loved the product, but, looking back, we didn‚Äôt hear much about their pain point. The pain we were solving turned out to be very low (helping people decide where to go out). It was a magical experience when it worked, and some people continued to use it, but for most people, it was more of a novelty than solving a real problem. We should have been more focused on the problem, and the pain we were solving, than the novelty of the solution.If you boil it down, to build a successful business, you need to solve a big enough problem for a big enough group of people to make a profit. Everything in this post is a way to help you find a bigger problem or a bigger group of people.Homework:Talk to 5 to 10 new customers, or potential customers, this weekRead Don‚Äôt confuse people rooting for you with market signalRead Four strategies for validating your B2B startup ideaRead How to validate your startup idea by Todd JacksonHow the most successful B2B startups came up with their original ideaHow the most successful B2C startups came up with their original idea2. Change your target audience/ICPYou may have the perfect solution to a different person‚Äôs problem.Instead of trying to bang your head against the wall to convince the same people they need your product, try pitching someone else entirely.The founders of Pinterest started off by pitching tech people, but almost by accident realized the group that needed Pinterest was 30-something female bloggers. The founders of Retool thought their product was for ops teams, but it turned out it was CTOs. DoorDash started with only independently owned restaurants in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Stytch first went after growth teams, but then realized engineers wanted it most. Netflix realized their initial target audience should be DVD fanatics in online communities, because that‚Äôs who most wanted endless DVDs. Instagram initially went after designers interested in photography who had large Twitter followings. Snapchat initially went after high school students in Orange County.Your target audience should also be very narrow. Almost comically narrow. Shoot for at least three narrowing characteristics. For inspiration, here are the original ideal customer profiles (ICPs) for top B2B products and, below that, the original target audience for top B2C products (what I call the ‚Äúsuper-specific who‚Äù).Why should your target market be so narrow? Several reasons:Focus: It‚Äôs hard enough to solve one big problem for one person. By focusing all of your efforts on this one use case, you‚Äôll have the best chance of solving a problem better than anyone else. Once you get one person to love you (which most products aren‚Äôt able to do), you can expand from there.‚ÄúThe goal is for a fledgling start-up to take customers away from an established incumbent by focusing all their power at a single point of attack.¬†This will be a problem that conventional solutions are not addressing well, one that is increasing in severity and attracting the attention of top management.¬†The start-up commits to solving this problem 100%.‚Äù ‚ÄîGeoffrey Moore, author of Crossing the ChasmDistribution: It‚Äôs easier to get people excited about your product if it feels like it‚Äôs made for them. It‚Äôs also easier to get in front of people with the same interests or problems. Tinder started with party-going college students at USC (one location). WhatsApp started with Russian emigrants in San Jose (one neighborhood). Discord started with PC gamers playing Final Fantasy XIV (one niche community). Instagram started with designers interested in photography who spent time on Twitter (i.e. easy to get to them), and from that beachhead expanded.

Instead, they wait for others to tell them a new product is worth their time. They wait for social proof. Early adopters, on the other hand, love new stuff. They‚Äôre less focused on pain points, and mostly just want to stay ahead. But once they get excited, they tell others. That‚Äôs how you cross the ‚Äúchasm.‚Äù‚ÄúWe want to light a billion-dollar bonfire. How do you light a billion-dollar bonfire if all you have is a match? You don‚Äôt hold it under a big log. You get some kindling together, you bunch some paper underneath it, you get your match, and you light the corner of the paper under the kindling, under the log.Until I get the fire started somewhere, I shouldn‚Äôt try to spread my heat.‚Äù ‚ÄîGeoffrey Moore‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot easier to boil a thimble than the ocean.‚Äù ‚ÄîSarah Tavel, GP at BenchmarkHomework:If you allow your ICP to fray, you‚Äôll loseHow to identify your super-specific who in B2CStories of how top B2B companies found their ICPCrossing the Chasm3. Change your positioning/messaging/pitchYou may have the perfect solution for the perfect person, but if they don‚Äôt understand how your product will help them, they won‚Äôt pay attention.In her amazing guest post, April Dunford relays how simply changing her team‚Äôs product positioning from a ‚ÄúMicrosoft Access killer‚Äù to an ‚Äúembeddable database for mobile devices‚Äù changed the trajectory of their business. In my post on crafting your pitch, I share stories of how DoorDash, Netflix, and Behance took off only once they figured out how to pitch their product effectively (and without changing the product itself).In the case of Ramp, all they had initially was the messaging:‚ÄúWhen we launched, in mid-2020, I think we had ‚Äòmessage-market fit.‚Äô We were able to differentiate and have people be interested in our unique messaging, but we didn‚Äôt have the product there yet. In terms of the product itself, where suddenly it was spreading, that came later, probably fall of 2020, when it was finally delivering on the messaging we had.‚Äù ‚ÄîEric Glyman, co-founder and CEOHere are examples of how some of the most popular B2C apps successfully pitched their products early on:Homework:How to craft your hookPositioning by April DunfordHow to build a killer sales pitch by April Dunford4.

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeP.S. Don‚Äôt miss Lennybot ‚ú® (an AI chatbot trained on my newsletter posts, podcast interviews, and more) and my new swag store (great gifts for your favorite PMs, or yourself!).Q: Do you have a favorite life motto that you come back to often and share with friends, either at work or in life?At the end of each podcast conversation, I ask my guests a series of ‚Äúlightning round‚Äù questions. A few months ago I added the question you see above. This has unexpectedly led to some of the most profound insights of the podcast. To kick off 2024 with a dose of inspiration, I‚Äôve pulled together my favorite and most meaningful life mottos‚Äîthe ones that have stuck with me most. As you read through this collection, pick one that strikes a chord and put it on a post-it on your monitor. The next time you find yourself in a place of stress or indecision‚Äîcome back to it. If you do this one thing today, your 2024 will already be brighter.1. ‚ÄúA positive mental attitude will be your key to success.‚Äù‚ÄúThis changed my life, really. When I was in fourth grade, a teacher‚Äîand I don‚Äôt remember which teacher it was, which kills me‚Äîwhen I was having a bad day, the teacher said to me, ‚ÄòListen, a positive mental attitude will be your key to success.‚Äô And I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs stuck in my head, but it did. I have said that to myself 100,000 times.I am a relentlessly positive‚Äîmy wife says I‚Äôm an offensively positive‚Äîperson. She‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòYou know what? Some days you can have a bad day.‚Äô And I said, ‚ÄòI just don‚Äôt. Because a positive mental attitude is my key to success.‚Äô And it‚Äôs really the way I frame so much of my life, looking to the positive, looking to the good. And I do it for people whenever I can. And sometimes it frustrates people. But I really believe that most of life is the mindset that you bring to it. For me in fourth grade, ‚ÄòA positive mental attitude will be your key to success,‚Äô for some reason, hit me at the right moment in the right way and has stayed with me ever since.‚Äù [Full clip]‚ÄîMatthew Dicks is a best-selling author, columnist, blogger, podcaster, playwright, and teacher. He wrote my all-time favorite book on storytelling, Storyworthy. He is an elementary school teacher by day and by night teaches storytelling and public speaking to individuals, corporations, universities, religious institutions, and school districts around the world. He‚Äôs taught storytelling at Yale, MIT, Harvard, and Purdue, along with Amazon, Salesforce, Slack, Lego, and others.2. ‚ÄúIt matters not how strait the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.‚Äù ‚Äî‚ÄòInvictus,‚Äô William Ernest Henley‚ÄúI love this quote because he was going through issues with his legs and was going to potentially lose them, and then wrote this quote. The last two lines, ‚ÄòI am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul,‚Äô is literally my Twitter/X bio. It‚Äôs such a powerful reminder of freedom and responsibility.‚Äù [Full clip]‚ÄîEbi Atawodi is a director of product management at YouTube, former head of product at Uber, and a former director of product at Netflix.3. ‚ÄúStrive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.‚Äù ‚ÄîAlbert Einstein‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great motto for people and also for companies. It‚Äôs something that guides me in my life.‚Äù [Full clip]‚ÄîItamar Gilad, the author of Evidence-Guided: Creating High-Impact Products in the Face of Uncertainty. He‚Äôs also a product coach, author, and speaker with over two decades of experience in senior product roles at Google, Microsoft, and various startups.4. ‚ÄúThe world is run by insecure overachievers.‚ÄùThis post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

How do you use that precious time to get the most‚Äîand most important‚Äîinformation?For over a year now, I‚Äôve been asking my illustrious podcast guests to share their favorite interview questions (nearly 150 guests now!), and the collection of questions that‚Äôs emerged is like nothing I‚Äôve seen elsewhere. These are not just great questions‚Äîthey are exceptionally good at pulling out the essential insights about the candidate in the least amount of time.Below, I‚Äôll share my 25 favorite high-signal-to-noise interview questions, including what to look for in a great answer, grouped by theme. If you‚Äôve found any other questions that are super-valuable in your interview experience, please share in the comments!Leave a commentThank you to Jeremy Jerschina for encouraging me to write this post, G√ºn Karag√∂z for consolidating a lot of these questions for me, and all of my podcast guests for sharing such amazing questions!As you read through this list, pick a few that resonate with your process and goals, and try them out in your next interview panel.How do they handle the hard stuff?You can learn the most about how a person operates, thinks, and collaborates by exploring times when things didn‚Äôt go as planned. If they get hired, you can guarantee they‚Äôll face unexpected challenges, so you‚Äôll want to know how they‚Äôll handle these moments before they have to tackle them on your team.1. Talk me through your biggest product flop. What happened and what did you do about it?‚ÄúI look for people being brutally honest about how bad it was and why it failed. The rest of the interview, they‚Äôre trying to tell you all the wonderful things they did and all the accomplishments they had. And so I think the rawer the answer in terms of how bad it was and why, the better.‚Äù ‚ÄîAnnie Pearl, corporate vice president at Microsoft, ex-CPO at Calendly2. What‚Äôs the hardest thing you‚Äôve ever done?‚ÄúI want to understand what hard means for them. I want to understand why it was hard. I want to understand how they overcame that difficulty, how they worked with other people to overcome that difficulty, and how much agency they had in overcoming that.‚Äù ‚ÄîGeoff Charles, VP of product at Ramp3. Tell me about a time you‚Äôve been in a challenging or highly ambiguous situation, and how you navigated that ambiguity.‚ÄúThis is a big one for me because, at the end of the day, the PM job is really ambiguous. It‚Äôs really hard to describe on a piece of paper all the things that you‚Äôre going to encounter. So I ask a lot of behavioral questions around that.I look for people who look for structure and a way forward through the ambiguity. Also, I look for people who seek help, seek inputs, versus ‚ÄòThis is the way.‚Äô ‚Äù ‚ÄîJiaona Zhang (JZ), head of product at Linktree, ex-SVP of product at Webflow@lennyrachitskyPause it and try before she reveals what she‚Äôs looking for! #productmanager #productmanagement #jobinterview #interviewquestions #interviewtips best job interview questions, job interview examples, product manager job interview, how to become a product manager, product manager jobs, product manager testTiktok failed to load.Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser4. Describe a time when you were part of a controversial product decision, and what you did.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really revealing, because if they can explain this conflict and understand why this problem was really important‚Äîand represent both sides such that you can understand why that conflict existed in the first place‚Äîand they can do it in this even-keeled way, where you realize that they can take on these different perspectives, you start to learn a lot about that person.‚Äù‚ÄîYuhki Yamashita, CPO of Figma5. Tell me about a time something went wrong. What happened and what did you do about it?‚ÄúThe question gets at when the product failed, and when something about the team didn‚Äôt work, because that‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôre doing this work. What are people‚Äôs mindset? I look at the way they talk about it and the way they relate to evaluating the situation. It really tells you a lot about how people think and how they perceive themselves when things are not working well.‚Äù‚ÄîPaige Costello, co-head of product management and head of AI at Asana6. What is the worst product that you‚Äôve ever shipped?‚ÄúIt tells me you have some humor, you‚Äôre humble, and you can point out when you‚Äôve made a mistake. You‚Äôve done enough to be able to confidently say, of course I‚Äôve made a mistake. Because none of us are perfect. And you know how to spot those mistakes and you can learn from them.‚Äù ‚ÄîMaggie Crowley, VP of product at Toast7. Tell me about a time when you needed to disagree with your manager or fight for a position against higher leadership.‚ÄúYou want to look for people who have backbone but can also disagree and commit. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm normally looking for.‚Äù ‚ÄîEthan Evans, retired VP at Amazon‚ÄúIt showcases a lot about your character and if you are willing to stand your ground and push up when you need to. What is that influential communication skill that you have?‚Äù‚ÄîInbal Shani, CPO of GitHubHow do they think?The strongest and most valuable candidates are people who are good at self-reflection and can approach problems differently. They break norms, they challenge assumptions, and they think from first principles. These questions can help you find  lateral and ‚Äúout-of-the-box‚Äù thinkers.8. What‚Äôs something that everyone takes for granted that you think is hogwash?‚ÄúI‚Äôm always looking for people to break this sort of interview mindset. Everyone always prepares for interviews, and then their entire conversation is predicting what you think you want me to say. As a result, you can have high-quality people that you dismiss because they weren‚Äôt genuine.There‚Äôs no way to answer that question without being genuinely opinionated. Because it starts with ‚ÄòWhat is the thing that you think...?‚Äô When I break that wall, I‚Äôm testing: is this person authentic? Because sometimes I‚Äôm dismissing them because they told me nothing new. But I don‚Äôt want the interview process to penalize them, and this was my ‚Äòsave‚Äô question.Sometimes I‚Äôll ask a manager, ‚ÄòLook, you‚Äôve managed hundreds of people in your career. What‚Äôs conventional wisdom that you bet against, that you have found is actually inaccurate?‚Äô You could do that for ‚ÄòWhat do people think about AI that‚Äôs inaccurate, that everyone believes?‚Äô You could do that for domains. You can do all kinds of things.‚Äù ‚ÄîNikhyl Singhal, VP of product at Meta9. What‚Äôs an unfair secret you‚Äôve learned to improve a product team‚Äôs velocity and energy level?‚ÄúWhen I say ‚Äòunfair‚Äô or ‚Äòsecret,‚Äô I mean not something that you read on Medium. I‚Äôm looking for what you learned, how you learned it, how it works, and how you apply it.‚Äù ‚ÄîNoah Weiss, CPO at Slack10. Tell me about something you did that worked out but not for the reason that you thought it would.‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to tease out introspection. Are you a person who is reflective about the decisions you made, why they worked, and why they did not? And do you incorporate that into your model so you make different decisions?‚Äù ‚ÄîAyo Omojola, CPO of Carbon Health11. What is an experiment you launched that had a very unexpected result? And what did you do after that?‚ÄúThis reveals the deep, deep level of their thinking. If you should expect that result based on what they described, then they are not thinking deeply enough. They are not understanding the customer enough.‚Äù ‚ÄîHila Qu, growth advisorHow do they build, ship, and drive impact?You‚Äôre likely asking questions along these lines already, but here are some clever ways to get to the juiciest bits.This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

Order now (while supplies last), and get it in January.Learn more and pre-order nowQ: I‚Äôve heard your podcast guests occasionally mention ‚Äúfirst-principles thinking.‚Äù What exactly is first-principles thinking, and how do I use it in my work?First-principles thinking, or thinking from first principles, sounds a lot more complicated than it is. It‚Äôs simply a technique for approaching problems with a beginner‚Äôs mind. Instead of working within assumptions and what people around you ‚Äúknow‚Äù to be true, you do the hard work of figuring out what‚Äôs actually true and, thus, what‚Äôs truly possible. There are many ways to apply the technique (which I‚Äôll share below), but essentially you do this by asking questions, challenging people‚Äôs assumptions, digging further than other people, and going directly to the source to find out for yourself.The concept of thinking from first principles comes from physics, is also known as ab initio, and encourages one to ‚Äústart directly at the level of established science and not make assumptions based on existing models.‚Äù Aristotle phrased it as ‚Äúthe first basis from which a thing is known.‚ÄùAny talk of first principles must include a quote from Elon Musk, so let‚Äôs get it out of the way:‚ÄúWe get through life by reasoning by analogy, which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations. And you have to do that. Otherwise, mentally, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to get through the day. But when you want to do something new, you have to apply the first-principles approach.‚Äù ‚ÄîElon MuskBefore we go further, it‚Äôs important to know that this technique takes a lot of effort. As Ozan Varol (former rocket scientist and best-selling author) explained in this interview with Farnam Street:‚ÄúThe primary downside [to first-principles thinking] is it‚Äôs really difficult. [‚Ä¶]Reasoning by analogy, or copying what others are doing, is sort of like being a cover band where you‚Äôre playing somebody else‚Äôs music. Whereas with first-principles thinking, you go back to the fundamental raw materials of music, which are the notes, and then you build an original song from scratch. That is first-principles thinking.It‚Äôs really difficult to do because a lot of what we do in life is informed by what we‚Äôve done before, and also by what others are doing around us. First-principles thinking, if you take it to an extreme, can be really inefficient, because we learn by emulating other people‚Äî[everything] from learning how to walk, learning how to talk, comes from copying others and modeling others.Part of the difficulty comes from picking what to question, because you can‚Äôt go through life questioning every single thing you do. Picking what to question and also using knowledge in a way that will inform, not constrain, you.‚Äù That being said, many of history‚Äôs biggest breakthroughs came from someone making the effort to think from first principles. This includes the classic examples of SpaceX and Tesla, the breakthrough that led to the transformer architecture driving today‚Äôs AI revolution, the invention of human flight, the discoveries of nuclear energy and general relativity, and so many more. It‚Äôs not an accident that history‚Äôs most important scientists come at problems in this way‚Äîwith a beginner‚Äôs mind:‚ÄúI have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.‚Äù ‚ÄîAlbert Einstein‚ÄúThe greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance; it is the illusion of knowledge.‚Äù ‚ÄîStephen Hawking‚ÄúBe less curious about people and more curious about ideas.‚Äù ‚ÄîMarie Curie‚ÄúEvery sentence I utter must be understood not as an affirmation, but as a question.‚Äù ‚ÄîNiels Bohr‚ÄúTo myself I am only a child playing on the beach, while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me.‚Äù ‚ÄîIsaac Newton‚ÄúThe task is not so much to see what no one has yet seen, but to think what nobody has yet thought, about that which everybody sees.‚Äù ‚ÄîErwin Schr√∂dingerTo make this even more concrete, let‚Äôs look at a bunch of examples across tech startups.Examples, big and smallAs you read through the examples, notice the way people go about thinking from first principles in practice. Essentially, they figure out what problem they want to solve, identify the levers that are keeping them from getting there, question every assumption about what‚Äôs possible within each lever, do the legwork to find out facts on the ground, and then act.Example 1: Building the Square Cash Card‚ÄîAyo OmojolaWatch this five-minute clip and notice Ayo‚Äôs approach to problem-solving:Notice something important that isn‚Äôt good enoughGo to the source (e.g. the factory) and talk to people to understand whyKeep asking questions until you ‚Äúget to the end‚Äù‚ÄúAnd so what happens is you go ask somebody something, and they would give you an answer which is the thing that they believe to be true. They‚Äôre not lying and it‚Äôs not malicious, but it‚Äôs just wonk.So you just have to keep pushing until you get to an answer. I don‚Äôt really know the right way to articulate this all the way, but basically, you can‚Äôt stop until you get to the end.‚Äù ‚ÄîAyo Omojola, CPO at Carbon HealthThe way that I apply this today‚Äîand I‚Äôm sure people at Carbon Health will tell you this‚Äîis I end up asking lots of questions that people think don‚Äôt matter. Because I‚Äôm like: hey, we‚Äôre trying to optimize something. And when you‚Äôre trying to optimize something for the first time, you have to look at it like 15 different ways. And then every time two things are incongruent, you have to go and figure out why. It‚Äôs just tedious work.‚ÄùExample 2: Building OpenAI‚ÄîIlya SutskeverWatch this two-minute clip and notice that the breakthrough that led to GPT (possibly the biggest breakthrough in software history) was rooted in experimenting with an idea that ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù knew wasn‚Äôt going to work.‚ÄúEverybody knew that you cannot train deep networks. It cannot be done. Back propagation is too weak. You need to do some kind of pre-training of some sort and then maybe you‚Äôll get some kind of an oomph. [‚Ä¶] Today we take deep learning for granted. Of course a large neural network is what you need. You shove data into it and you‚Äôll get amazing results. Everyone knows that. Every child knows that. How can it be that we did not know that? How could such an obvious thing be not known? People were really focused on machine learning models, where they could prove that there was an algorithm which can perfectly train them, but whenever you put this condition on yourself, and you require to find a simple elegant mathematical proof, you really end up restricting the power of your model.‚Äù For more, here‚Äôs another video of Ilya sharing this same lesson.Example 2b: The key to Stripe and OpenAI‚Äôs success‚ÄîGreg BrockmanIn this one-minute clip, notice how a company like Stripe, one of the most valuable tech startups today, didn‚Äôt do anything that special. They just built a much better product than was previously available, simply by ‚Äúnot being locked into the way that people had been doing it‚Äù before, by thinking about every single piece of what they were doing from the ground up.‚ÄúA lot of how we approached Stripe was thinking from first principles. I remember when we were pre-launched and we had some buzz going because we had some early customers, and one of my friends took me out to lunch. He was a VC, and he was like, ‚ÄòAll right, look, I‚Äôve been hearing about this Stripe thing. What‚Äôs your secret sauce?‚Äô I was like, ‚ÄòI mean, we just make payments really good.‚Äô And he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòNo, no, come on, you can tell me, what‚Äôs the secret sauce?‚Äô And that really was the secret sauce. We rethought every single piece of what we were doing from the ground up, from first principles. Not locked into the way that people had been doing it. We asked how should it be? Where‚Äôs the pain and does it need to be there?In AI, we did much the same thing. We thought about, OK, there‚Äôs this field that we‚Äôre entering and that we hire a lot of people who had been in the field, but a lot of us also hadn‚Äôt been in the field, and we came to it with beginner‚Äôs eyes. That approach of just not being beholden to all the ways people were doing it, but also becoming expert in the way that things have been done. Because if you just throw everything out, you‚Äôre also just going to be starting from scratch, in a not-helpful way.‚ÄùExample 3: Julia Child learning to cookThis post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

Lenny's NewsletterSubscribeSign inShare this post500,000www.lennysnewsletter.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOther500,000Ten lessons learned from building this newsletterLenny RachitskySep 11, 2023875Share this post500,000www.lennysnewsletter.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOther137ShareThis week the newsletter hit 500,000 subscribers, which I‚Äôm told makes it among the top five largest newsletters on Substack and one of the largest newsletters broadly. Friggin‚Äô bonkers.A big round number is a good time to reflect, so I‚Äôve collected some lessons from my journey. I still only sort of know what I‚Äôm doing, and it‚Äôs unclear where this all goes, but if you‚Äôre thinking about embarking on a writing journey, or are just curious about this path, I hope you find this useful.To everyone who reads this newsletter, has been a paid subscriber, or has even just shared a post with a colleague‚Äîfrom the bottom of my heart, thank you for allowing me to do the most meaningful work of my life üß°ü•πüôèLessons learned1. Quality + consistency = all that mattersThings that don‚Äôt matter: your design, your title, your strategy, your growth plan, vision . . . most things.Things that matter: quality, consistency.There‚Äôs no trick to making something like this grow. Growth comes from publishing something valuable, that people want to share with their friends and colleagues, over and over and over.If your newsletter isn‚Äôt growing, it‚Äôs most likely either a quality problem or a consistency problem. Here‚Äôs some advice for improving both.‚ÄúStrive not to be a success, but rather to be of value‚Äù ‚ÄîAlbert Einstein2. Do your ‚Äújob to be done‚Äù better than anyone else in the worldYou can bucket every great newsletter into the ‚Äújob‚Äù it‚Äôs doing for people:Help me parent better: ParentData by Emily OsterHelp me cook better: Broken Palate, a newsletterHelp me understand what‚Äôs happening in tech: Stratechery, PlatformerHelp me understand what‚Äôs happening in the world: Noahpinion, The Free PressInspire me: Adam Grant, Austin KleonEntertain me: Seeing Things, Alphabet SoupThere are many more categories of jobs, and there‚Äôs room for many winners within each category. So you don‚Äôt necessarily need to be the best in the world. But you should strive to be.My newsletter‚Äôs job-to-be-done is to help you get better at work‚Äîspecifically, building and growing your product and career. If I can do this job super-well for you, consistently, you‚Äôll keep reading.Start by figuring out what job you‚Äôre doing for someone by answering these two questions:Who exactly is your audience? Think of a specific person‚Äîwhat would they find extremely interesting or useful?What is the concrete job you‚Äôre doing for them? Is it entertainment, helping them make money, inspiring them, helping them understand the world, something else?3. Follow your energyWriting consistently is a grind. Best-case scenario, you‚Äôll be thinking, writing, and learning about this topic for years. To continue to do this work at a high caliber, you need to be genuinely curious about your topic area. Otherwise, you will create a job for yourself that you will hate.To find a topic that is right for you:Follow your energy. What topics give you energy to think about, write about, and talk about? What saps you of energy? Spend more on the former and less on the latter. This one trick will tell you a lot.Make sure it‚Äôs based on your real-life experience. You need to know what you‚Äôre talking about. People can tell if you don‚Äôt. Notice how the best newsletters are by people who have deep experience in that space. What‚Äôs at the center of the Venn diagram of your unique skills and background that together create an interesting topic?Pay attention to what people value. I deliberately made this the third item because many people start here, which is a trap (see below). But it‚Äôs still important for there to be people who care about your ideas. What do people often ask you for advice about? What has been the most helpful thing you‚Äôve shared with friends? Where do you find pull from others?Finally, it‚Äôs important to find a niche (aka build a personal monopoly), but be careful about getting too niche. You have to write/think/learn about one narrow topic for a long time, and if it‚Äôs too narrow, you‚Äôll get bored as hell. If I followed the classic advice of picking a narrow niche, I‚Äôd have focused on just product management. But I don‚Äôt care about product management that much. I‚Äôm interested in the wider space of building products, helping them grow, improving your career, and building startups. So I kept my focus areas broad and went where my interests took me. Although this made it harder to explain what my newsletter was about, the topics were close enough to make sense together, and I was able to stay excited about the work.As a good rule of thumb, start by getting 1,000 people to think your newsletter is the best newsletter in the world. Interestingly, when I hit 1,000 paid subscribers, I was able to make a real living from this newsletter.4. Spend more time on itYou may feel like there are a billion newsletters out there‚Äîhow can you possibly break through? I felt the same way when I started. It turns out that 99% of the content in the world is not very good. There‚Äôs always room for, and interest in, better content. You just need to rise above what‚Äôs already out there. And that takes work.I spend a median of 10 hours per post. Some posts take hundreds of hours (like this series). There‚Äôs a strong correlation between the time I spend on a post and how well it does. This is also why it‚Äôs hard to do this well when you have a full-time job.Along these lines, any time you have allotted for working on your newsletter that is not writing (and making your writing better) is time wasted. Many newsletter writers spend time optimizing their website, creating a brand, crafting a big strategy around their newsletter‚Äîand their growth slows. If you can spend almost zero time working on anything that isn‚Äôt creating the content itself, you‚Äôll have an advantage. This is actually why Substack is so great. I can focus exclusively on the writing and they do everything else.Speaking of Substack, the recommendations feature is a total game changer. IMHO it‚Äôs one of the most impactful growth features in history (which I explored in a recent podcast episode) and, as you can tell in the graph above, totally changed the trajectory of my newsletter. The way it works is newsletter authors can recommend other newsletters they enjoy. Currently, over 9,000 other newsletters recommend my newsletter üò±. It‚Äôs not because of anything I did actively. It all comes back to what I said in point #1‚Äîif people find your stuff valuable, they‚Äôll want to share it with others. More significantly, thanks to this feature, there‚Äôs never been a better time to start a newsletter. If you create great stuff, other authors will recommend it, and you‚Äôll grow faster than at any other time in history.5. Cut 30%-50% of your wordsBefore I started this newsletter, I‚Äôd never written anything publicly, taken writing courses, or studied writing. But after doing a bunch of writing, and reading three impactful books (On Writing Well, Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t, and Several Short Sentences About Writing), the biggest lesson I‚Äôve learned is to cut, cut, and cut some more.Cut every word that isn‚Äôt absolutely necessary. Make your intro 50% shorter. Get into the meat of your post as quickly as possible. As Wes Kao puts it, ‚ÄúStart your story right before you get eaten by the bear.‚ÄùAs an example, with almost every guest post that I edit, if I remove the first paragraph of the first draft, the post immediately gets stronger. Try this with your next piece of writing. Cut the intro and get right into it.6. Contribute something new to the conversation Most writing is a rehashing of something that‚Äôs already been said, or a superficial pontification that people don‚Äôt need. What are you adding to the conversation? What new ideas, insights, and concepts are you contributing? This is what people want.Most of my top newsletter posts are the result of my spending tens of hours doing primary research and uncovering new insights that haven‚Äôt been shared before. I‚Äôm doing a lot of work on behalf of the reader, so it makes sense that people find it valuable.To do this well, consistently, you need to have real-life experience in the space you‚Äôre writing about. Many people start writing publicly without having done much in their life or career, and they run out of experiences to tap into. This is why I continue advising work on the side, to not lose complete touch with the real work.If you‚Äôre considering going all-in on content creation, my advice is to first spend many years (e.g. 10) actually doing the work. Build up as much real-life experience as you can first. This also gives you more ‚Äúcareer optionality,‚Äù as Elena Verna describes:‚ÄúI finally realized that I set out the wrong end goal for myself. Leadership title should have never been the end goal‚Äîonly a step toward the ultimate unlock: career optionality.Career optionality may look different for people, but it materialized into becoming a solopreneur for me. As a solopreneur, my brain is my product, and I created a solo business around it with various monetization streams: advising, interim, public speaking, workshops, course creation, etc. VP titles validated my abilities and impact, aiding my journey toward solopreneurship. But only in solopreneurship did I find a happy place for my career: fulfilling, flexible, challenging, and impactful work.So do set out the goal to get to the leadership titles, which are quite valuable. But not as an end destination. Work towards unlocking career optionality as an end goal, which will enable you to craft your career any way you‚Äôd like.‚Äù7. Commit to a consistent cadence, and make sure it‚Äôs sustainableHaving a deadline to ship is an essential forcing function to write consistently. Here‚Äôs how I created a deadline for myself when I launched the newsletter. Pick a cadence, share it publicly, and try your hardest to stick to it. A weekly cadence is a great starting point. People often start publishing at too fast a rate and quickly burn out. I can only sustainably write one great post a week. Crazies like Ben Thompson, Noah Smith, and Heather Cox Richardson can do this almost daily. Others can do it only monthly. All these routes are fine. Depending on your goals, even one incredible post a year is very valuable. The key is to find a cadence you can keep up for years.Remember, quality + consistency = you win, and people don‚Äôt want more emails. They want better emails.8. Get started by just getting startedJoan Didion said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I think until I write it down.‚Äù I write not to share a crystallized thought I have in my head, but instead to mold a rough idea into something that makes sense.What‚Äôs something that you want to get out of your head and crystallize? Start with that. Write it out, and share it online. Just see how it goes. Don‚Äôt overthink it. And I‚Äôd post it on Substack or a similar platform so that you can start collecting email addresses, in case it does turn into something.Here‚Äôs my first piece that I put out publicly. It came out of my simply wanting to remember what I learned from my time at Airbnb. I found that people found it valuable, so I wrote more stuff. And it continued from there.People always ask how I got going with the newsletter, so here is what that looked like:First 100 subscribers: Medium post about Airbnb ‚Üí helped me grow Twitter audience ‚Üí tweeted that I‚Äôm launching a newsletter ‚Üí first 100 subscribersNext 1,000: Guest post on First Round Review and Andrew Chen‚Äôs blogNext 10,000: Writing useful stuff every week for 9 months ‚Üí tweeting summaries of it + word of mouthNext 100,000: Writing useful stuff every week for 2 years ‚Üí tweeting + word of mouthNext 200,000: Continuing to write useful stuff week after weekLast 200,000: Continuing to write useful stuff week after week + Substack‚Äôs recommendations feature9. It‚Äôs not all rainbows and butterfliesThere are major downsides to this life. No PTO, no benefits, no 401(k) matching, and no one to write for me if I‚Äôm sick. To take parental leave, I had to work doubly hard for a couple of months to create a backlog of content.Also, unless I shut this thing down, in theory I have to write an awesome newsletter every week for the rest of my life. I‚Äôm used to it now, but this is what every week basically feels like:10. This is the most fulfilling work of my life, and I highly recommend itNever did I imagine this was where my life would take me, but I followed what gave me energy, and this is where I ended up. As a result, I now do the most fulfilling work of my life. My personal mission is to help people get better at their work, and to increase net happiness in the world, and I feel like I‚Äôm doing this at scale. I‚Äôm so incredibly grateful.Thank you for being a part of this journey, and for continuing to read, subscribe, and share. The best is yet to come.Subscribeüìö If you want moreA recent Fast Company profileA presentation I once gave on creating a writing habitA presentation I once gave on launching the paid planAn impressive reverse engineering of my newsletter journey (though the numbers aren‚Äôt totally accurate)My most popular posts of all timeSincerely,Lenny üëã875Share this post500,000www.lennysnewsletter.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOther137SharePreviousNext137 CommentsShare this discussion500,000www.lennysnewsletter.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOtherKyle PoyarKyle Poyar‚Äôs Growth Unhinged Sep 11, 2023Liked by Lenny RachitskyWhat an amazing journey!

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeWelcome to part two of kickstarting and scaling a B2B business. Here‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at:Part 1: How to come up with a great B2B startup ideaPart 2: How to validate your idea ‚Üê This postPart 3: How to identify your ICPPart 4: How to find and win your first 10 customersPart 5: How to find product-market fitPart 6: How, and when, to hire your early teamPart 7: How to scale your growth engineLet‚Äôs get into it.A huge thank-you to Akshay Kothari (COO of Notion), Ali Ghodsi (CEO of Databricks), Barry McCardel (CEO of Hex), Boris Jabes (CEO of Census), Calvin French-Owen (co-founder of Segment), Cameron Adams (co-founder and CPO of Canva), Christina Cacioppo (CEO of Vanta), David Hsu (CEO of Retool), Eilon Reshef (CPO of Gong), Eric Glyman (CEO of Ramp), Guy Podjarny (CEO of Snyk), Jori Lallo (co-founder of Linear), Julianna Lamb and Reed McGinley-Stempel (co-founders of Stytch), Mathilde Collin (CEO of Front), Rick Song (CEO of Persona), Rujul Zaparde and Lu Cheng (co-founders of Zip), Ryan Glasgow (CEO of Sprig), Shahed Khan (co-founder of Loom), Shishir Mehrotra (CEO of Coda), Sho Kuwamoto (VP of Product of Figma), Spenser Skates (co-founder and CEO of Amplitude), and Tomer London (co-founder and CPO of Gusto) for contributing to this series. Art by Natalie Harney.Forty percent (nearly half!) of the companies I spoke with went through at least one failed idea before discovering something that worked. Some went through 10. As Christina Cacioppo eloquently put it, ‚ÄúOur first couple of ideas were just total crap.‚Äù Many shared the same sentiment. Here‚Äôs how some of today‚Äôs biggest B2B startups began: Retool started as Venmo for the U.K.Amplitude started as a voice recognition application that allowed you to send and receive text messages by talking to your phoneSegment started as a university classroom lecture toolVanta started as B2B AlexaNotion started as a no-code website builderLoom started as a marketplace for companies to hire subject-matter expertsSlack started as a game called GlitchBox started off as a ‚Äúbox‚Äù to put photos and content in on FacebookThe question we‚Äôll be tackling in today‚Äôs post is this: Once you have your startup idea, how do you know if it‚Äôs a big idea or . . . total crap? Below, I‚Äôll share:How the best founders validated their ideaWhat specifically convinced them to go all-inHow many people they spoke to before committing to the ideaWhat true pull looks likeWhich companies pivoted and which had the right idea from the startSome of my biggest takeaways and surprises:Founders spoke to a median of 30 potential customers before feeling like their idea was solid.Outbound sales is consistently the best signal for validating your idea (versus friends using your product, incubator batch-mates, or investor leads).Only about a third worked with design partners.There are four ways to validate your startup idea‚Äîand it‚Äôs fairly clear which path you should take depending on your product and your experience in the problem space.There are four signs your idea has legs:People pay you money: Several people start to pay for your product, ideally people you don‚Äôt have a direct connection toContinued usage: People continue to use your prototype product, even if it‚Äôs hackyStrong emotion: You‚Äôre hearing hatred for the incumbents (i.e. pain) or a deep and strong emotional reaction to your idea (i.e. pull)Cold inbound interest: You‚Äôre seeing cold inbound interest in your productEvery prosumer collaboration product, including Figma, Notion, Coda, Airtable, Miro, and Slack, spent three to four years wandering in the dark until they stumbled on something that clicked. I‚Äôll share these stories below.As I mentioned, about 40% of startups pivoted at least once before landing on their winning idea‚Äîoftentimes more than once. This rate is a lot higher than in B2C, where it‚Äôs closer to 20%.Four strategies for validating your B2B startup ideaAcross two dozen interviews, I noticed four distinct paths to effectively validating a startup idea:The do-it-manually path: Don‚Äôt build anything‚Äîsolve the problem manually first, for a small number of companiesThe listening path: First talk to tons of potential users, and then start buildingThe prototype path: Start building a prototype and then co-create it with a small number of design partnersJust launch and see how it goesIf you look closely, all four paths are just different ways to validate the same things we focused on in part 1‚Äîpull and pain‚Äîwith varying degrees of up-front investment. Here‚Äôs what pain and pull look like in practice:People pay you money: Several people start to (or offer to) pay for your early product, ideally people you don‚Äôt have a direct connection to.Strong emotion: You‚Äôre hearing hatred for the incumbents (i.e. pain) or a deep and strong emotional reaction to your idea (i.e. pull).Cold inbound interest: You‚Äôre seeing cold inbound interest in your product.Continued usage: If you‚Äôve got a prototype running, people continue to use your product even if it‚Äôs bad.1. The do-it-manually path: Solve the problem manually for a small number of companiesThis path is a great choice for founders who are unclear whether the problem they are going after is important, or even solvable. Though it was the least common path, when done right, it can unlock huge lessons with very low up-front investment.In the case of Vanta, Christina Cacioppo sensed there was a big opportunity in the compliance/security space but wasn‚Äôt confident the pain was that bad. So she manually created compliance reports for a few companies and noticed (surprisingly) that they all found them very valuable:‚ÄúThere was about a six-month process before we started coding where we talked to about two dozen companies. Initially I simply answered security questionnaires for a company myself. They sent me their old questionnaires and they would send me new ones, and I would manually do the copy and paste.At the time, no one really got SOC 2 certifications, and we didn‚Äôt know anything about them. I went and read two dozen SOC 2s and then went to a company and did a readiness assessment for them. We made them a SOC 2 report card in a spreadsheet, interviewed all their people, and wrote out, ‚ÄòHere‚Äôs all the stuff you have to do for a SOC 2.‚Äô And the test there, honestly, was: one, would they spend time with us, and two, would they believe us? Would they think the spreadsheet was useful?We did this first with Segment, and they really liked it. We were like, ‚ÄòWait, really? Are you serious?‚Äô Then we went and took our spreadsheet to Front, and we basically gave it to Front. We did a find-and-replace in the doc from ‚ÄòSegment‚Äô to ‚ÄòFront.‚Äô And that was a test of whether that‚Äôs useful to Front. Can we standardize this? And that actually was useful to Front.And then we got an email from an old Dropbox colleague who was like, ‚ÄòI hear you guys have become SOC 2 consultants. That‚Äôs super-weird. I thought you were going to do other things with your life. But also, can you come do this for my company?‚Äô And that‚Äôs when it was like, no, but I‚Äôll start writing code. That was the validation process for us.‚Äù‚ÄîChristina Cacioppo, founder and CEOThe founders of Ramp did the same thing with savings reports:‚ÄúWe came at it with this theory of: We‚Äôre experts in savings, and we‚Äôre really interested in this idea of a credit card that would save your business money. We think we can save you money, but we want to prove it to you.So we did these things we called ‚ÄòSavings reports,‚Äô where we would ask founders for the last 90 days of their credit card purchases or ACHs and‚Äîmanually, but they didn‚Äôt know it was manual‚Äîcome back to them with ideas to save their business money.One of the early aha moments there was a company that was legitimately spending money on seven different project management tools. They were growing so fast that they had forgotten to cancel the subscriptions. They had adopted Basecamp and Trello and Asana and Smartsheet, and all these things that they later abandoned. I think it was a hundred grand on software they weren‚Äôt using. We came back and were like, ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs $200,000 in savings. You don‚Äôt have to use us, just go and enjoy this tip. But by the way, this is what our software does, and we can do this for you ongoing and automatically.‚Äô‚Äù‚ÄîEric Glyman, co-founder and CEO2. The listening path: First talk to tons of potential users and then start buildingThis path should be your default, unless you have a clear sense of what you need to build. Go this route with the goal of speaking with around 30 potential customers, looking for pain and pull (see above what that means).The founders of Zip spoke with 75 potential users before committing to their idea:‚ÄúWe did a lot of interviews with CFOs, heads of procurement, heads of finance (I think the exact number is around 75), and over the span of two to three weeks. It really helped refine that idea. We had like 110 pages of notes or something in those two or three-ish weeks. Turns out the response rate is pretty good on LinkedIn when you just want advice.We would be like, ‚ÄòAll right, we had these three ideas. These two suck, but maybe we should tweak this idea because of what these two or three people said.‚Äô And so we‚Äôd keep honing it down, honing it down, honing it down, iterating every day.We also had a very stringent list of, I think, 16 criteria for the idea we were going to work on. And this idea actually met all of them.Zip‚Äôs actual 16-point checklistBut we were very honest with ourselves. We worked on a bunch of terrible ideas before, and if there‚Äôs anything we had learned, it‚Äôs that today will be the easiest day to kill the idea and do something better. It‚Äôll always be harder tomorrow because you‚Äôll have more customers if you‚Äôre fortunate (or unfortunate). You‚Äôll be more emotionally attached to it; you‚Äôll have more sunk cost.‚Äù‚ÄîRujul Zaparde and Lu Cheng, co-foundersThe founders of Stytch spoke with about 30 people and noticed there was universal hatred (i.e. pain) for the existing solution. Then they started building, and launched quickly, per the advice of their lead investor:‚ÄúWe talked to about 30 people over the course of a few months, mostly fintech developers, but also friends that weren‚Äôt in the fintech space that know how to build authentication. We asked them what they used for authentication and what they thought of it. For most of them, it was either Auth0, Google Firebase, AWS Cognito, or in-house. And pretty universally, everyone hated whatever they were using. It turned into a snowball of momentum, where at a certain point it just seemed inevitable that we were going to do this.We specifically didn‚Äôt go the design partner route, and instead focused on getting a self-serve product out as soon as possible, specifically an email magic links product.Chetan (our lead investor at Benchmark) gave us advice that selling authentication to large companies would take a long time, since they‚Äôd need a lot of features. The advice we had gotten was if they really want just this one product, that‚Äôs great. Let them be a design partner and partner with you. More likely, they‚Äôre probably going to keep asking for things that aren‚Äôt in your ability to serve them right now. So see what you can do to serve that broader long tail of the internet with your wedge and see if you can get that going. If really we had built for only one of those, we probably would‚Äôve waited another year to launch.‚Äù‚ÄîJulianna Lamb and Reed McGinley-Stempel, co-foundersThe founders of Gusto had an extremely similar experience, both in terms of finding real hatred for the existing solution and also talking to exactly 30 potential customers:‚ÄúI had 30 people I talked to about the original idea. This is before we wrote a single line of code and before we actually committed to the payroll idea. We had a list of 30 people that Josh [Reeves, co-founder] and Eddie [Kim, co-founder] and I knew one way or another‚Äîsome from Stanford, some from other networks‚Äîand I asked them for the names of¬†friends who had small businesses. And for every call we did, we asked them, ‚ÄòWho are your friends who have small businesses?‚Äô I literally was calling people out of Yelp.¬†Over time, if you look at the first call transcript and compare that to the 30th call transcript, it‚Äôs a very different call. In the beginning, you‚Äôre very open, exploratory, lots of different ideas and options. In the end, it was really mostly validating what you‚Äôre seeing.The thing I was looking for in retrospect is emotional reaction. When you talk with a customer and you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòHey, here‚Äôs a new type of mint. The reason why it‚Äôs different is because it‚Äôs organic and it‚Äôs local,‚Äô and then the person says, ‚ÄòOh yeah, that‚Äôs cool.‚Äô You say, ‚ÄòWould you buy it?‚Äô They‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòYeah, yeah, I may buy it.‚Äô That‚Äôs not the feedback you‚Äôre after. That basically means that, no, they‚Äôre not going to buy it. They‚Äôre just being nice.What you‚Äôre looking for is really, really deep emotion. So, what I heard from people was extreme frustration with their current payroll providers. The moment you just asked them the simple question of ‚ÄòWhat do you feel about your current payroll provider, your payroll system?‚Äô they started cursing, literally. More than half of people just started cursing and being really upset. When you hear that strong emotion, then you know you have something.‚Äù‚ÄîTomer London, co-founder and CPOGuy Podjarny, the co-founder of Snyk, spent time talking to dozens of potential users before building anything, not so much to validate the problem (it was obvious) but to make sure that if he built the solution, companies would embrace it:‚ÄúThe value in getting security built into the development process was already well recognized, so I didn‚Äôt need to validate the idea. What I needed to firm up was whether if I built the solution, developers would actually embrace it. Therefore, my early conversations were not with security people but rather with developers and entrepreneurs, especially founders of companies in the DevOps space.I had several dozen such conversations in the opening days, and focused not on finding potential customers but rather on deeply understanding what it means to build a dev tooling company, and how it differs from a cybersecurity one.DevOps founders were quite supportive of the idea, and agreed with both the need and the opportunity. They‚Äôve all seen or run companies that disrupted incumbents by embracing a DevOps approach. The few security people I spoke to were skeptical, agreeing it‚Äôd be valuable but not believing it possible. This firmed up my conviction that this was the right problem to tackle. I thought, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs hard, but if I pull it off, it‚Äôll be big.‚Äô‚Äù‚ÄîGuy Podjarny, co-founder and CEOThe founders of Ramp spoke to more than 100 potential users before jumping in and building anything (even before building their manual solution):‚ÄúBefore we shipped a single card, we talked to over 100 finance and founder teams. We‚Äôd reach out to old YC batch-mates, or old friends who left companies and went to other companies; also the founders in the New York tech ecosystem.‚Äù‚ÄîEric Glyman, co-founder and CEOYou may think you‚Äôve talked to enough people, but don‚Äôt stop until you‚Äôre seeing evidence of real pull (e.g. money, usage, strong emotion, cold inbound). Spenser Skates, the founder of Amplitude, stopped at 30 conversations and later realized he should have talked to more:‚ÄúWe did not talk to nearly enough. We talked to 30 different companies within a month. I should have aimed higher, like 50 companies in a month. But we talked to 30 in a month before building anything at all just to see, ‚ÄòHey, is this something potentially interesting?‚ÄôAnd out of that group, there were probably 10 folks that we identified that could potentially use this, and then five that had so much of a need they might pay money. Out of that group of 30, how many ended up being paid customers? A grand total of zero. We knew there was a need, but we made the mistake after that month of going straight to building, because we were like, ‚ÄòWell, instead of having all these speculative conversations, we actually want to have something to show people.‚ÄôSome of them used it, but were they interested in paying money? Hell, no. I think in retrospect, I should have continued dedicating half of my time to going out and talking to customers. But that‚Äôs in retrospect. In the end, though, it worked out.‚Äù‚ÄîSpenser Skates, CEO and co-founder3.

Lessons from going freemium: a decision that broke our business

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeP.S. Don‚Äôt miss Lennybot, my AI chatbot that‚Äôs trained on every newsletter post and every podcast interview.I‚Äôm increasingly on the lookout for stories of failures, because failure can hold the most enduring lessons. So when Bobby Pinero (CEO of Equals) tweeted about how adding a freemium plan nearly destroyed his business, I asked if he‚Äôd go one layer deeper and share his experience more widely. Below, Bobby tells the in-depth story of why his team decided to add freemium, why it didn‚Äôt work, and the many lessons they learned along the way.Every founder without a freemium plan grapples with the question of whether they should go freemium or not. My hope is that this post makes the decision easier for you.For more from Bobby Pinero, follow him on X and LinkedIn, and check out Equals. And a big thank you to Elena Verna and Patrick Campbell for important feedback on early drafts of this post.It seems almost every SaaS founder wrestles with the question of freemium. Do we or don‚Äôt we?The temptation is real.This is the story of what happened when we opened the floodgates by going freemium, and how it nearly destroyed our business.Below, I‚Äôll share our biggest lessons, including:The customer can be wrong. Users may scream for freemium. Investors and advisors will agree. It might even start OK (we 4x‚Äôd users right out of the gate). But initial usage is different from long-term usage. For us, engagement, retention, and revenue tanked.¬†‚ÄúFreemium‚Äù and ‚Äúfriction‚Äù are tied at the hip. The success (or failure) of freemium can be directly impacted by friction in onboarding. If you change one, you probably need to rethink the other.¬†Adding onboarding friction can be good. The prevailing sentiment is that friction in onboarding is bad. Not true. Friction can be critical to driving short-term adoption and long-term retention.The allure of seeing a new product is the strongest motivator new users have to complete setup. If you make onboarding too easy, they‚Äôll never come back to do the hard task you let them skip.When freemium can work. It requires a specific set of things to come together. And time, which you might not have.Ultimately, freemium didn‚Äôt work for us. That doesn‚Äôt mean it couldn‚Äôt work for you. My hope is that you‚Äôll learn from our experience‚Äîand hopefully, we‚Äôll learn from you too.How it all startedFirst, some context. What is Equals? It‚Äôs a next-generation spreadsheet‚Äîone that allows you to query, analyze, and report on live data. Think business intelligence, but in the familiar and flexible form of a spreadsheet.¬†We launched Equals in April 2022. We made a big splash.We had a successful initial launch on Product Hunt, finishing in the top five and later being a finalist in the Golden Kitty Awards.Because expectations for how a spreadsheet should look and feel are insanely high, we gated initial access to the product. We onboarded every single customer manually. We wanted to understand their use case. We wanted to establish a close relationship so they‚Äôd give us the benefit of the doubt when they inevitably ran into issues.From day one, you couldn‚Äôt get Equals without (1) jumping on a call with us and (2) paying up front. There was no trial. There was no self-serve version of Equals. It was about as high-friction an onboarding process as you can get in SaaS.That strategy worked really well. In fact, it worked so well that revenue took off. In just five months, we were able to raise a $16 million Series A funding round from one of the best investors in the world, a16z.¬†And then we broke everything.Everyone wanted less frictionAfter being in the market for a handful of months, we started to hear a lot of complaints on how we onboarded folks. It all boiled down to some version of ‚ÄúEquals looks amazing, just let us into the product!‚Äù¬†They wanted a self-serve option.¬†They wanted a way to skip our data source requirement during onboarding.¬†And most of all, they wanted a free plan. Not a free trial. No time limit or credit card required.It felt like we were missing a massive opportunity.It was easy to imagine all of the customers and users we were turning away. It was easy to look at the darlings of SaaS‚Äîcompanies like Notion, Figma, Airtable, Canva‚Äîand think that what worked for them would work for us. Let‚Äôs get people into the product, we thought, and we‚Äôll figure out how to monetize them later.¬†This began a six-month journey in which we tried giving folks what they wanted: a faster and frictionless way into Equals.We started by introducing a free plan.Introducing freemium (and removing a lot of friction)When we announced our Series A, we opened up Equals to the world:‚úÖ No more onboarding call required‚úÖ Prices slashed for current and future customers‚úÖ A generous new free plan. Stay under the limits, and Equals was free indefinitely for you.¬†üöß However, we still did require people to connect a data source to get started.¬†Let the masses sign up, we thought. And they did. For a little while, at least.We knew ARR would take a hit short-term, with the bet that we‚Äôd drive more companies to get stuck into Equals and drive ARR higher long-term. As a result, we reoriented the entire company, board, and investor base to focus on the metric of weekly active companies, not ARR. Our North Star was now to get as many companies using Equals as possible, with the belief that we‚Äôd later monetize them.Almost immediately, we 4x‚Äôd the number of companies using Equals on a daily and weekly basis.But then, over the course of the next few months, we stalled. And struggled to retain companies.¬†Initially we grew from the buzz surrounding our Series A announcement, but that growth stalled.The initial surge in new, active companies came from pent-up demand. Many were people who were on our waitlist who for some time had been looking to try Equals. Once we‚Äôd worked through that initial demand, we quickly got to a point where we couldn‚Äôt grow our active company base. For every new company we‚Äôd bring in, someone else would drop off‚Äîa precarious situation.¬†For freemium to work, we knew we needed to quickly and aggressively grow the number of active companies using Equals. Knowing that only a small fraction of active companies would ever convert to paid over time, not growing our active company base was an early indicator that we‚Äôd struggle to grow revenue at the rate we needed to in the future.Giving people (more of) what they wantWhile Equals was now free to get started, we still had a decent amount of friction in onboarding. We still required users to connect a live data source‚Äîyou couldn‚Äôt create a workbook and actually see ‚Äúthe next-generation spreadsheet‚Äù until you‚Äôd completed this critical step. And it wasn‚Äôt working. So we heeded the feedback we continued to get: ‚ÄúJust let us in!‚Äù¬†This only made things worse.As we embarked further down the path of less friction, our hypothesis and goal was to accelerate the number of new companies making it deep into Equals. We thought perhaps that the more they got into the product, perhaps the more motivation they‚Äôd have to ultimately get set up‚Äîby seeing Equals, they‚Äôd see the potential of what it could do! Perhaps some people would even use us without a data source.¬†We ran two key experiments.First, we allowed users to get started by using a CSV as a data source instead of requiring them to connect to a database or data warehouse. The thinking: everyone has access to and can upload a CSV file.Nope. This only hurt engagement further.¬†Yes, more people made it to the step of using the product. But ultimately fewer of them became engaged, retained users. Not only were fewer people getting stuck in, but we were actually losing people who would have otherwise connected a live data source. It turned out that less friction cost us engaged users. Which in hindsight makes sense‚Äîa CSV is stale data. You‚Äôre missing most of the value of Equals when auto-updating analysis on live data.Next, we tried a more extreme experiment. We allowed everyone to bypass the data source setup step altogether. Just get them in, let them see the next-generation spreadsheet. We also created setup guides, in-product nudges, and follow-up messages all pushing folks to connect a data source thereafter.¬†And it worked! We blew up. Thousands and thousands of active companies using Equals.¬†Just kidding. It was awful.¬†At this point, we were stuck in the mud.Undoing the damageThe original plan: raise our next round of funding by showing an exploding base of active companies, and from there generate revenue over time. Yet here we were, stalled, unable to grow incremental active companies despite having listened to and acted on what everyone told us they wanted or what we should do. It was quickly clear that we weren‚Äôt putting ourselves in the best position to raise a meaningful Series B.¬†As a venture-funded startup, we simply didn‚Äôt have the time to keep tweaking. To keep experimenting. To keep trying to make freemium work. Now we had the evidence we needed to act with conviction.Both the results we were seeing in the data and our early traction selling Equals told us we needed to (1) kill free and (2) add friction back to onboarding. Quickly. And once we did, everything changed.¬†Although we didn‚Äôt bring back all the friction.¬†We still held the fundamental belief that Equals should be self-serve. The next-generation spreadsheet should be something anyone could sign up for and get started with, so we didn‚Äôt believe it was right to go back to selling only through sales calls. We felt a strong pull to make a self-serve option work.¬†Yet we intuitively knew that the data source requirement itself wasn‚Äôt enough for users to have ‚Äúskin in the game‚Äù‚Äîto have that motivation to get to the aha moment and activate. So this time we decided to require every signup to start a 14-day free trial and input a credit card, a step between a free self-serve product and having to get on the phone with us. This worked.ARR (and customers) almost immediately bounced back. And it‚Äôs important to add that we didn‚Äôt change pricing for anyone who signed up during the free period; we didn‚Äôt force anyone who originally signed up for free to suddenly start paying. This growth was all new customers.But even more interestingly, the number of deeply engaged users went up.¬†Here we measure the number of users who are active in Equals three days a week.With the same number of new companies signing up, we were once again growing the number of customers and ARR but also the number of companies active in Equals. We were once again activating and converting people who in the previous world would have signed up and dropped off.¬†Reintroducing the data source requirement certainly helped. But requiring the credit card up front‚Äîand getting rid of freemium‚Äîseemed to have the biggest positive impact in helping users activate.¬†This is not what users were asking for. Nor what advisors told us. Nor what you‚Äôd imagine when you look at the darlings of SaaS.Which brings us to the most important lessons and reflections from this period.¬†Onboarding is more sales than it is product¬†Onboarding is a game of convincing a new user to keep going. It‚Äôs about momentum.¬†We found two real ways to build and maintain momentum. First, the allure of seeing a new product is the strongest motivator a new user has to complete complex setup tasks. If you need your users to do something that you believe is fundamental to their seeing value from your product, don‚Äôt let them skip it. Their motivation to do it will only decrease.¬†In all of our pursuit of getting people into the product, the thing we forgot is that the goal of onboarding is not for people to complete onboarding. It‚Äôs not to just get people into the product. The goal of onboarding is for people to get their first moments of value from your product. To get ‚Äúactivated.‚Äù And removing friction is actually detached from this goal.Second, we found that forcing users to invest upfront, in the form of a credit card and a limited-time window to make a decision, adds inertia and urgency to get set up. The act of putting in their credit card increases their level of commitment to go through the hard steps. A free plan does the opposite.Your users may tell you otherwise, but this is why adding friction to onboarding can outperform.Maybe freemium isn‚Äôt for every productObviously for some companies it works. Notion, Figma, Airtable, Canva, Miro, Loom, to name a few.¬†Many still believe it‚Äôd work for Equals.Having been through this at Equals, and drawing from our experience building Intercom, here are a few guiding questions to consider as you think about whether freemium could work for your business:This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, here‚Äôs what you missed this month:How today‚Äôs top consumer brands measure marketing‚Äôs impactHow Shopify builds productWhat is good free-to-paid conversionSubscribe to get access to these posts, and every post.SubscribeMy paternity leave has come to an end, and I‚Äôm kicking things up a notch. Over the next two months, I‚Äôm going to share a multi-party in-depth playbook for kickstarting and scaling a B2B business. This series took hundreds of hours of work and is based on dozens of 1:1 interviews with the founders of two dozen of today‚Äôs most successful B2B companies‚Äîincluding Gong, Notion, Figma, Amplitude, Retool, Canva, and many more. In addition to these juggernauts, I‚Äôve also pulled in a handful of my favorite up-and-coming B2B startups, including Linear, Vanta, Stytch, Zip, Census, Persona, and Hex.This series builds on my two previous playbooks‚Äîfor consumer businesses and marketplace businesses‚Äîand brings me one step closer to my goal of giving every founder a tactical guide for turning their idea into reality. Even if you‚Äôre not building a B2B startup right now, you‚Äôll find inspiration, new ideas, and frameworks that will help you with the product you‚Äôre building right now. Here is what‚Äôs in store:Part 1: How to come up with a great B2B startup idea ‚Üê This postPart 2: How to validate your ideaPart 3: How to identify your ICPPart 4: How to find and win your first 10 customersPart 5: How to find product-market fitPart 6: How, and when, to hire your early teamPart 7: How to scale your growth engineYou‚Äôll find never-before-shared stories, surprising lessons, and, as usual‚Äîa ton of tactical and actionable advice you can use to grow your own product today.Here‚Äôs a peek at a few of the more surprising takeaways:The majority of founders had no special skill or background in the problem space they went after.Most B2B startup ideas did not come from the founder feeling the pain at their last gig (though many did).Every prosumer product (e.g. Notion, Figma, Airtable, Miro, Slack, Coda) took two to four years of wandering in the dark before they found something that worked.Founders spoke to a median of 30 potential customers to validate their idea before committing.~40% of startups pivoted at least once before landing on their winning idea‚Äîoftentimes more than once.About 20% were solo founders.Cold outbound works‚Äîit‚Äôs the second most common way to get your early customers.This series should probably be a book, but instead I‚Äôm sharing it with you all here. I‚Äôm excited to hear what you think and evolve this work further. And remember: following these steps (or any steps!) won‚Äôt guarantee success. But it‚Äôll certainly improve your odds. Let‚Äôs get started with step one: coming up with a great idea.A huge thank-you to Akshay Kothari (COO of Notion), Ali Ghodsi (CEO of Databricks), Barry McCardel (CEO of Hex), Boris Jabes (CEO of Census), Calvin French-Owen (co-founder of Segment), Cameron Adams (co-founder and CPO of Canva), Christina Cacioppo (CEO of Vanta), David Hsu (CEO of Retool), Eilon Reshef (CPO of Gong), Eric Glyman (CEO of Ramp), Guy Podjarny (CEO of Snyk), Jori Lallo (co-founder of Linear), Julianna Lamb and Reed McGinley-Stempel (co-founders of Stytch), Mathilde Collin (CEO of Front), Rick Song (CEO of Persona), Rujul Zaparde and Lu Cheng (co-founders of Zip), Ryan Glasgow (CEO of Sprig), Shahed Khan (co-founder of Loom), Shishir Mehrotra (CEO of Coda), Sho Kuwamoto (VP of Product of Figma), Spenser Skates (co-founder and CEO of Amplitude), and Tomer London (co-founder and CPO of Gusto) for contributing to this series. Art by Natalie Harney.What makes a great B2B startup ideaIf you boil it down, there are essentially three elements to a great B2B startup idea:Ingredient 1: The problem is important to peopleThere need to be a lot of people willing to spend a lot of money to solve the problem. Most startups fail not because the idea isn‚Äôt good but because the market for the solution is just too small. If you want to build a venture-scale business, a rule of thumb is that there needs to be a clear path to $100m in revenue per year, and eventually a path to $1B a year. Here‚Äôs a great example of what you want to see, as told by Ryan Glasgow, CEO of Sprig:‚ÄúRobinhood agreed to a large contract even though we were early. They‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòWe love it. We‚Äôll install tomorrow.‚Äô They installed it as we were building the first version.‚ÄùHunter Walk has a great framework called LUV. Also, here‚Äôs my take on what makes a venture-scale idea, and a guide to help you think through your market size.Ingredient 2: The market is underservedExisting solutions need to be doing a subpar job of solving the problem. The founder of CRED, Kunal Shah, has a great framework for evaluating potential new solutions, called Delta-4:What would a customer rate the existing solution on a scale of 1 to 10?What would they rate your solution?Your solution needs to be +4 better for anyone to care about your product. This also means that if the existing solution gets a 6 or higher, it‚Äôll be very hard to replace (e.g. Excel). Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôd love to see, as shared by Tomer London, co-founder of Gusto:‚ÄúAs soon as we asked them the simple question of how they feel about their current payroll provider, they started cursing. More than half of the people we talked to just started cursing, unprompted. Two people voluntarily told me, ‚ÄòI use [competitor name], and my password is fuck[competitor name].‚Äô‚ÄùIngredient 3: You‚Äôre excited about solving this problemFinally, the problem needs to be something you are willing to spend many years of your life solving. This advice from Dylan Field, co-founder of Figma, captures the sentiment perfectly:‚ÄúThere are actually a lot of good ideas out there. It‚Äôs kind of the weird part, especially if you‚Äôre searching for one; it feels like it‚Äôs not the case, but there are so many different markets that are underserved. The more important thing, actually, is to find something that you are personally passionate about, because any good company takes a long time to build.If you are, let‚Äôs say, three to four years in on an idea that you hate, you‚Äôre just going to burn out and you‚Äôre going to quit. It won‚Äôt feel good and you‚Äôll be hating life. Don‚Äôt just go for an idea because it‚Äôs kind of working. Go for an idea that you really care about, because even if it doesn‚Äôt work, you‚Äôll still learn from it and you‚Äôll still have one.‚Äù ‚ÄîDylan Field, co-founder and CEO of Figma, via Elad GilTakeaway: Find an idea that solves a problem that is important, underserved, and that you‚Äôre excited about. You‚Äôll hear a lot more about how to do this, and what this looks and feels like, below.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs essential to work on something you‚Äôre deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could. When in doubt, optimize for interestingness.‚Äù‚ÄîPaul GrahamFinding a great B2B startup ideaAcross all of the interviews I did, I found three reliable paths for discovering a great idea:Past pain: Identify a large pain you experienced at a previous company‚Äîthen build a solution.Ponder and probe: Pick a space you‚Äôre interested in, then whiteboard and tinker while talking to dozens of potential customers‚Äîlooking intently for pain and pull.Present pull: Identify something you‚Äôve built that is showing signs of pull‚Äîand pivot fully to that.Here‚Äôs an overview of how today‚Äôs biggest B2B companies found their ideas:No matter which path you take, you are looking for two things: pain and pull. Pain tells you there‚Äôs an opportunity to solve a problem, and that it‚Äôs important. Pull tells you that you‚Äôre actually solving the problem.Let‚Äôs explore each of the three paths, illustrated by founder stories.Path 1: Past pain‚ÄîIdentify a large pain you experienced at a previous company. Then build a solution.When I first started this research, I was expecting this path to be the way that all great startups found their ideas. Surprisingly, it only accounts for about 40% of great ideas.Let‚Äôs consider five successful startups that found their big idea following the path of past pain: Gong, Retool, Linear, Persona, and Hex.The CEO of Gong experienced the pain of being unable to understand what was going wrong within the sales process at his previous company:‚ÄúAmit, now my co-founder, ran a company in the BI space called Sisense. He ran into a problem‚Äîwhen sales didn‚Äôt work well‚Äîand it was very hard to understand why. He realized that essentially all of the knowledge about what was working and not working was hidden inside people‚Äôs heads: ‚ÄòThe CRM was showing me stuff, but it wasn‚Äôt anything meaningful. Yes, you didn‚Äôt close that deal, but why?‚ÄôHe left Sisense and looked around to see if anybody was addressing this problem. I was on sabbatical doing nothing, learning deep learning, so we figured: let‚Äôs try to come up with a system that takes the stuff from salespeople‚Äôs heads, captures the information, and gives visibility and guidance to the rest of the organization.‚Äù‚ÄîEilon Reshef, co-founder and CPODavid Hsu, the founder of Retool, found himself building the same product over and over at each company he worked at:‚ÄúPerhaps a little-known fact is that I had actually started a couple of other companies and products before Retool. And every time the team built any of these products, we had to go build our own tools for it. Eventually, when you build enough of the same things‚Äîin this instance, internal tools for different projects‚Äîyou kind of realize they actually all have the same building blocks. We thought, ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs got to be a better way of doing this.‚Äô And we‚Äôre lazy engineers and we thought other engineers would be lazy as well. So that‚Äôs how the idea [for Retool] first came about.‚Äù‚ÄîDavid Hsu, founder and CEOThe founders of Linear felt deeply disappointed every time their companies defaulted to Jira:‚ÄúLinear emerged out of the pain we all felt with issue tracking project management, when it comes to building software. I was at the time at Coinbase, Karri [Saarinen, co-founder] was at Airbnb, Tuomas [Artman, co-founder] was at Uber. We were all at these growth-stage companies and saw how they both grow and operated as they grew.I very vividly remember the time around 2016 at Coinbase, when we were closing in on 100 people and we hired a VP of engineering. There was a desire to start unifying the teams using a single tool. And Jira started coming up in the conversations.I was maybe a little bit naive and tried to keep my team using Trello, but I very quickly realized that it is a losing battle. You‚Äôve just got to go with it and there‚Äôs no other solution, basically, on the market. And so we ended up going with Jira. But it just stayed with me as this nagging feeling of disappointment. Separately, Karri at Airbnb had created a Chrome extension to re-skin their Jira, and Tuomas was building developer tools at Uber, using Fabricator. We all had similar experiences of ‚ÄòThis doesn‚Äôt feel right and we should do something about it.‚Äô‚Äù‚ÄîJori Lallo, co-founderPersona‚Äôs founder noticed how inadequate identity tooling was when having to build this technology at Square:‚ÄúI worked on identity over at Square for a fair bit of time. We actually used to joke as a collective team over on Square, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sure in 10 years there will be someone who does this well for us.‚Äô Importantly, while we were building it, we noticed that there was this disconnect between existing identity vendors thinking that there was going to be one technique that‚Äôll solve all of a customers‚Äô identity problems, while in reality, every business had a multi-modal approach: a bunch of different techniques to verify different people in different contexts. So we saw an opportunity to go after this problem in a unique way.‚Äù‚ÄîRick Song, co-founder and CEOHex‚Äôs founder realized that no one was going to build what he needed, so he had to do it himself:‚ÄúI actually started this journey as a buyer. I was looking for something like Hex and I couldn‚Äôt find it. It took me a few months of going around and talking and asking people like, ‚ÄòOh, what are you using for this? What are you using for that? Have you found anything good for this?‚Äô Everyone said, ‚ÄòNo, but if you do, let us know.‚Äô It kind of clicked one day. I was like, ‚ÄòWell, maybe we should do this.‚Äô I didn‚Äôt set out to be a founder. There are a lot of people out there who are like, ‚ÄòI want to be a founder. I just need an idea and a co-founder.‚Äô I was almost the opposite. The idea was very obvious to me. I had two great co-founders that I had met at Palantir whom I loved working with. It almost took us a while to be like, ‚ÄòAll right. I guess we have to do this. Don‚Äôt we? No one else is doing this, while we have to do it.‚Äô‚Äù‚ÄîBarry McCardel, co-founder of HexTakeaway questions to reflect on:What did you or others build at previous jobs that proved to be incredibly valuable to the company, or your teammates?What‚Äôs a tool you wish you had (and would have paid a lot of money for) at your previous companies?What internal products have you built again and again at past companies?Path 2: Ponder and probe‚ÄîPick a space you‚Äôre interested in, then whiteboard and tinker, while talking to many potential customers looking for pain and pull.A surprisingly large number of founders came up with their startup idea by doing something that‚Äôs often discouraged: sitting around and whiteboarding. As you‚Äôll see below, there‚Äôs a wrong way of whiteboarding and a right way (i.e. ideating and building in a silo versus quickly talking to potential users to validate your idea). But most importantly, if you want to find a great idea, again, focus on finding a problem space with three traits: (1) it‚Äôs important, (2) it‚Äôs underserved, and (3) you‚Äôre excited about it. Ideally your idea is also rooted in some experience you‚Äôve had in the space, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be.Figma‚Äôs founders narrowed their focus to two areas they saw potential in and then started tinkering with the one they were most excited about‚Äîdesign:‚ÄúAfter we got the Thiel Fellowship, I called Evan [Wallace, co-founder] and said, ‚ÄòHey, you know, we‚Äôve got actual funding now: $100,000 over two years. Do you want to go do this thing for real?‚ÄôWhen you‚Äôre starting a company, it‚Äôs really useful to ask the question: why now? It‚Äôs a really useful framework. It can be societal; maybe there‚Äôs some new cultural trend. Perhaps it‚Äôs regulatory; some law has been passed or repealed. I like the technological version. For us, we saw drones in 2012 and WebGL as a few technologies that were happening. Because of them, new possibilities were suddenly there.On the drone side, we didn‚Äôt get very far. Evan in particular was not that interested in doing hardware. He‚Äôs like, hardware sucks, run debug cycles are really long, and then we focused on WebGL instead.We were also excited about computational photography for a bit, but quickly realized that with photos, that ends up leading to a consumer sort of application. And the entire purpose of WebGL was to be in the browser. Why would you do anything in photo editing if you‚Äôre not on the phone? And so we felt like we were kind of building in the wrong place and then eventually sort of shifted our attention to design. I had been a design intern at Flipboard, and that kind of helped me realize what would be possible there.‚Äù‚ÄîDylan Field, co-founder and CEO, via Elad GilVanta‚Äôs Christina Cacioppo similarly narrowed down her thinking to two spaces that felt ripe for opportunity that she was excited about (security and collaboration), and kept talking to customers to find the biggest source of pain and pull:‚ÄúOur first couple of ideas were just total garbage. There was a lot of whiteboarding. I think the failure mode in this part of the process with the whiteboard is that it‚Äôs just all so abstract. There were no customers or users.¬†Back then, I tended to be a shiny-object person, so left to my own devices, my natural inclination was just to go find all the shiny objects on the surface. So I was, okay, no, don‚Äôt do that. Pick one or two spaces and go really deep. You‚Äôre not allowed to look at anything else. Not allowed.I chose (1) team collaboration tools, because I thought, I don‚Äôt know if I truly love this but I know it from my Dropbox days, and (2) security, because it seemed interesting and I wanted to learn it. They both seemed big and important, and interesting, and I had all kinds of security and compliance challenges at Dropbox. I also felt like I‚Äôd be happy learning about that space, and I also wanted to work with startups.Within collaboration, we were asking ourselves, ‚ÄòWhat are the macro trends and new technologies shaping the world?‚Äô It‚Äôs late 2016, and so . . . voice! Team collaboration software is also emerging, and so the answer is B2B Alexa. At the whiteboard stage, it makes so much sense. And in reality, zero sense. We recognized that if you can do it on a whiteboard, someone has probably done it. There‚Äôs no $20 bills on the sidewalk.Also, when you‚Äôre changing context from B2B Alexa to other ideas like, I‚Äôm going to make a better wiki, to solving security, to whatever, you‚Äôre spreading yourself too thin and you‚Äôre not going deep enough to actually learn anything that someone else hasn‚Äôt.So within the security bucket, I started asking all the startups I knew about security, and they all looked at me really guiltily and said, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt really do anything. We know we should, but we don‚Äôt.‚Äô Everyone wanted to do security, but it was hard to prioritize until customers asked for it. So I started doing it for them scrappily and manually, and that led to what Vanta is today.When I tell founders this, sometimes they‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòWell, how did you know security was going to work?‚Äô You don‚Äôt. If you know the answer to that, go for it. But it‚Äôs only obvious if you look back.‚Äù‚ÄîChristina Cacioppo, founder and CEONotion started with the general idea of a no-code app builder and eventually (four years later!) noticed pull for a specific set of features:‚ÄúEarly Notion was basically a no-code website builder. Some of the videos actually exist in YouTube. It didn‚Äôt go anywhere for years. It was very unstable, the tech stack we had used in the early iterations of it was fairly buggy, and user feedback was not great. But as we peeled the onion, talking to users and using it ourselves, we realized that for the people that continued to use it, they liked some elements of the editor and the collaborative features that the product had. And through that, we realized that we should double down on docs and wiki.The turning point was in early 2017 (four years in), when we launched Notion 1.0, focused around just docs and wikis. At the same time, we made a few different templates ourselves so that you can click a button and start using the product. Instead of telling people to build software using our tool, you can now click a button and get this modern docs/wiki product, without any work. It proved to be a great wedge into the market, because notes is the simplest unit of work, and it got people in the door and using the product. And then once people actually started using it, some people went down to the lower stack and they were like, ‚ÄòHuh, I can actually change these things. I can modify it, I can build my own template.‚Äô We took a little bit of a roundabout way of getting there, but that‚Äôs the story.‚Äù‚ÄîAkshay Kothari, co-founder and COOFor Zip, Rujul Zaparde and Lu Cheng went through a variety of ideas, looking for a big and underserved market they were excited about. They eventually focused on procurement (and their company is currently valued at over $1B):‚ÄúThis was actually our sixth or seventh idea. Some earlier ideas included allowing people in India (and then other countries) to be able to buy U.S. equities in a fractional way, and an accounting staffing platform (which generated $200k of revenue!).Eventually, as we were thinking through our next pivot, the advice we got from our Y Combinator partner was to¬†look for a market¬†that was large and had entrenched companies that weren‚Äôt great. This led us to the¬†procurement space.And then we thought back to this problem at Airbnb. In hindsight, we both adjacently ran into it a couple of times, but we didn‚Äôt realize it until later.‚Äù‚ÄîRujul Zaparde and Lu Cheng, co-foundersFor Databricks, Ali Ghodsi noticed a new technology emerging that was underutilized and kept talking to users until he realized how to turn it into a real company:‚ÄúWe were doing research for a bunch of years at U.C. Berkeley and had started seeing what was happening in Silicon Valley tech companies, how they were solving data scalability problems, and how different their approach was from what we were seeing in the rest of the industry. At that time, the rest of the industry was leveraging this technology called Hadoop, and that was the best thing since apple pie for them. But we were seeing that the Silicon Valley tech companies were using a different technology (what is now Apache Spark) and were in fact doing AI and machine learning on data, and they were getting magical results. We knew this technology could be game-changing for the rest of the industry. Our initial thought was, ‚ÄòCan we just take what we‚Äôre seeing over there, open source it, and publish the research, and then the whole world will adopt it and we‚Äôve changed the world?‚Äô We didn‚Äôt really intend to start a company. But then over the years, it was frustrating to see that we had found this software, and we had open-sourced it, and we thought it was so amazing, but it wasn‚Äôt getting the uptake that we thought it deserved. And people kept telling us, ‚ÄòThis is some academic project. How do we know that we can really rely on it? Is it really enterprise-ready?‚Äô And so on. There was frustration around 2012 where we thought, if we start something, if we ourselves get behind it and we raise some money, maybe we can really actually ourselves make it happen. So that was the journey.‚Äù‚ÄîAli Ghodsi, co-founder and CEOTakeaway questions to reflect on:What‚Äôs a trend that‚Äôs emerging but underserved (e.g. security, collaboration)?What‚Äôs a transformative technology that‚Äôs emerging that‚Äôs underutilized (e.g. data scalability)?How many potential customers have you spoken with about your idea?How important to potential customers is the problem you‚Äôre exploring, on a scale of 1 to 10?How underserved is the current market, on a scale of 1 to 10? And where would your solution rank? Look for a delta of at least 4.Path 3: Present pull‚ÄîIdentify something you‚Äôve built that is showing signs of pull. Pivot fully to that.A final path is simply to keep building what you‚Äôre building, but pay special attention to features or functionality that are showing strong pull from existing users. This may lead to shifting your approach slightly, or it may lead to a completely different product.In the case of Amplitude, the big idea came from noticing other founders wanting access to their internal analytics tool:‚ÄúWe started with a different company before Amplitude, called Sonalight, which was a voice recognition application that allowed you to send and receive text messages by talking to your phone. One of the things that was really clear to us at the time was that you should look at what people are doing in your product in order to figure out how to make it better. Figure out where people are getting stuck, what keeps them coming back, what they like to use, and what they don‚Äôt like to use. We tried out tons of products on the market. I remember Flurry, Google Analytics, Adobe, Kissmetrics, and others. And none of them were able to answer the questions I just posed. And so we said, ‚ÄòAll right, well, we‚Äôve got to build it ourselves.‚Äô A bunch of engineers with a lot of hubris, haha. So we ended up doing that. And as we shared those insights with other companies that we knew (we were at Y Combinator at the time), they were like, ‚ÄòWow, that‚Äôs amazing. I really need to understand that about my business.‚Äô‚Äù‚ÄîSpenser Skates, co-founder and CEOSprig followed a very similar story‚ÄîRyan Glasgow was building one product, but then noticed a side project seeing much more pull:‚Äú‚Äã‚ÄãI was exploring a startup idea, but I wasn‚Äôt quite getting the pull I expected. I went back to what I knew, which is product management, and I started asking users tough questions, like ‚ÄòWould you pay for this?‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhy do you not use this?‚Äô In this discovery process, I wanted to add more rigor, knowing that this was a high-stakes decision (e.g. I‚Äôd be spending 10-plus years of my life on it), and I found a technique called outcome-driven innovation, which adds rigor to product innovation. I was like, ‚ÄòWow, this is mind-blowing. What if I could build a tool to help other people go through the idea maze and not build something before they de-risk the idea?‚ÄôSo I built a little SDK that people could plug into their apps, with a very simple front end, that would just rotate through three questions about functionality, usability, and quality (the core questions in the framework I mentioned). It used Airtable as the back end, actually; it was so simple. I shared this with other founders that I knew who were also trying to get their business off the ground, and gave them this spreadsheet of quality, usability, functionality, using this framework. And they were like, ‚ÄòWow, I‚Äôm learning so much. I‚Äôd be your first customer if this was a product.‚Äô It immediately clicked. They would say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll pay you for this.‚Äô ‚ÄãThis was the market pull I was looking for, and I quickly pivoted to surveys.‚Äù‚ÄîRyan Glasgow, co-founder of SprigThe Loom founders went through two completely different products before seeing obvious pull within one unexpected feature of their app:‚ÄúLoom was the result of two previously failed attempts in the video space. Our first was a marketplace for companies to hire subject-matter experts (i.e. product managers, designers, engineers, etc.) for feedback on checkout flows, UX, sales funnel, onboarding, and more. While we saw initial revenue here, this failed to get the traction to warrant additional build time (we were already four months in at this point). The second was a SaaS tool that any company can embed on their website and get instant feedback from their users in the form of a user test. Similar to the first iteration, this failed to get any real momentum after three months, although it led us to a remarkable insight from one of our few design partners.Three months into this second idea, we had an aha moment when a client used the product to record a video of himself summarizing all of the user tests his team had collected. That‚Äôs when it occurred to us that there could be something here.A month later, we launched on Product Hunt and had thousands of people who‚Äôd downloaded the extension by day‚Äôs end. That made it clear to us that we should double down on this new direction, and we‚Äôve never looked back.‚Äù‚ÄîShahed Khan, co-founderWith Segment, nothing was working for a year and a half, and while throwing ideas against the wall, one idea finally stuck:‚ÄúWe originally applied to YC with the idea for a university classroom lecture tool (we were college students at the time), and we built that out over the course of the summer. It failed because we aren‚Äôt good at identifying real problems, and we decided that one reason is that we didn‚Äôt understand our users.We spent about 15 months pivoting and building various analytics products to help better understand users. None of them really took off, and we keep chasing the next idea that will get us users. As a growth hack, my co-founder Ilya built a little library called Analytics.js. The idea was that users can use it as a ‚Äòdrop-in replacement‚Äô for Mixpanel or Kissmetrics and send us the exact same data as you would to each of them via one library. Users didn‚Äôt care much about our tool, but they seemed to like the idea of Analytics.js.Finally, we have about six months of runway left and we haven‚Äôt launched anything. My co-founder Ian [Storm Taylor] thinks that the idea behind Analytics.js could actually be a big deal. We could effectively be the ‚ÄòAPI layer‚Äô over all these annoying and similar, but inconsistent, data tools.We‚Äôre split on the decision. Peter thinks it‚Äôs the worst idea he‚Äôs ever heard and that there‚Äôs zero chance a company could be made from 100 lines of JavaScript. We all agreed to build it for a week and launch it on Hacker News. That day, it goes straight to the top of HN, and the rest is history.‚Äù‚ÄîCalvin French-Owen, co-founder of SegmentAnd famously, for Slack, the big idea came from noticing one feature being incredibly popular within their ill-fated video game:‚ÄúWe came to the conclusion that Glitch [the game he was working on] was never going to be the kind of business that would have justified the $17.2 million in venture capital investment [that we raised]. It might have been a neat project for a half-dozen people if we had spent a million dollars to get there, but by the end of 2012, there were 45 people working on it, we had spent many millions of dollars, and it just wasn‚Äôt ever going to scale. So we decided to shut it down without knowing what we were going to do next.The company still had millions of dollars left in the bank, and one of the possibilities was to return that money to the shareholders and call it a day, maybe start something else up. But because we had that money, we had the flexibility to shut it down in what we felt like was a humane way. We spent a long time working on reference letters for the employees who built the website, essentially to make sure that they all got jobs.We also gave users the choice to get a refund for everything they had spent, to let us keep the money, or donate it to charity. We kind of had our hands full for a little while in shutting the game down, and while we did that, we were thinking about what we might want to do next. There were all kinds of ideas.It took us a little while to settle on the idea that would become Slack.That was really born out of the style of communication that developed while we were working on the game. We used an older technology called IRC, and because IRC is very limited, over the years we added the little features here and there that we wanted.For example, in IRC, if you‚Äôre not online at the same time as me, I can‚Äôt send you a message. I have to wait until you are also connected. So one of the first things we did was build a way of archiving messages so that you could catch up when you came back online, and in those archives we wanted to be able to search them, so we added search, and so on. There was no good iPhone client, so we made an HTML5 front end for our archive viewer. This interesting dynamic happened. By the time we shut down the game, again there were 45 people at the company, we had been in operation for three and a half years, and we had a companywide email list. After more than three years, it only had 50 messages on it, so about one every three weeks. That wasn‚Äôt a deliberate decision, that wasn‚Äôt ideologically driven. But it just happened that everyone paid attention to IRC, and the more people paid attention to it, the more information we routed to it; and the more information we routed to it, the more people paid attention to it. So eventually, everything from database alerts to daily sales figures were being pumped into IRC. Every time someone uploaded a file to the file server, that would be posted into IRC. While we weren‚Äôt successful in making the game, we were very efficient in being unsuccessful to make the game.‚Äù‚ÄîStewart Butterfield, founder, via Business InsiderTakeaway questions to reflect on:Of all the things you‚Äôve built, what one feature is showing the most pull?What problem are you currently facing with your startup that you wish someone would solve? Explore solving it yourself.What‚Äôs a side project you‚Äôve been wanting to build that you haven‚Äôt?To summarize, if you‚Äôre trying to come up with a great B2B startup idea:Look for ideas that are (1) important, (2) underserved, and (3) you‚Äôre excited to solve.Pick one of these routes and ask yourself these questions:Past painWhat did you or others build at previous jobs that proved to be incredibly valuable to the company or your teammates?What‚Äôs a tool you wish you had (and would have paid a lot of money for) at your previous companies?What internal products have you built again and again at past companies?Ponder and probeWhat‚Äôs a trend that‚Äôs emerging but underserved (e.g. security, collaboration)?What‚Äôs a transformative technology that‚Äôs emerging that‚Äôs underutilized (e.g. data scalability)?How many potential customers have you spoken with about your idea?How important to potential customers is the problem you‚Äôre exploring, on a scale of 1 to 10?How underserved is the current market, on a scale of 1 to 10?

Since it was very expensive to fix flaws you found at the end of a year-long release cycle, we tried to get security to ‚Äòshift left‚Äô‚Äîto find issues during development where it‚Äôs cheaper to fix them.I left that path to found my first startup, Blaze, building a real-time web page compiler that made websites faster. Blaze was acquired by Akamai, where I became the CTO of the web performance business. DevOps played a key role in that journey, and the perspective helped me appreciate the impact it will have on the industry‚Äîand the opportunities it brings. These two lenses made me realize two things:At the pace of DevOps, getting developers to embrace security has gone from an efficiency and costs play to a necessity. It‚Äôs the only way for software to be secure.If you build the right solution, developers can and will embrace security. DevOps had proven that by getting developers to embrace ops, with tools like New Relic, Heroku, and others paving the way.So after leaving Akamai, I set out to build a developer tooling company that tackled security.‚Äù‚ÄîGuy Podjarny, founder and CEOAll three of Canva‚Äôs founders noticed a gap in the design space:‚ÄúMel [Melanie Perkins, co-founder and CEO] was teaching design through university, including how to use different types of design software, and through that experience, she realized that it was quite complicated and really hard for people with no design background to start approaching these tools and actually get something useful out of them.And I‚Äôd created a lot of creative tools over the previous decade, which I found unlocked people‚Äôs creativity in a whole bunch of different ways, like with music and drawing, and other creative tools. I‚Äôd worked at Google on a product called Google Wave, which was all about communication and collaboration, and again, being able to unlock people‚Äôs creativity through new technology and new experiences.When I met Mel and Cliff [Obrecht, co-founder and COO] in 2012, the idea of unlocking design and creativity really captured all of our imaginations, and so we decided to band together in July 2012 and start building that first product. We eventually launched Canva in August 2013, about a year later.‚Äù‚ÄîCameron Adams, co-founder and CPOSame story for Stytch:‚ÄúWe had a monthly coffee chat on our calendar after Julianna [Lamb, co-founder] left Plaid to go to Very Good Security. We were always just catching up and often complaining about work, what we were banging our heads against the wall on. And that week, we were both banging our head against the wall on authentication. It was the number one thing I worked on at Plaid. And so I was particularly frustrated. And then Julianna had just finished a project to rip out Auth0. A project had gone on for six months before she joined, and then it was taking so long that they‚Äôd stopped doing it and then later picked it up again. It was like a meme within the company because of how annoying a project it was and how much time it was taking. Julianna was talking about how frustrating it was internally there, I was talking about how we just had a really bad experience with Auth0 and AWS Cognito at Plaid. And we were just surprised that everything assumed you‚Äôre using a password in terms of how the APIs were designed, but also, you didn‚Äôt have much flexibility.And so that was the first time we were both complaining about the same thing, which led it to being the first company idea where I think what we said was: we just presumed there would‚Äôve been a Stripe for authentication in terms of how easy it was to work with an API, to do this rip and replace Julianna was doing or add the password-less features that we were trying to add in the Plaid.So December 2019 was the coffee. We had left our jobs at Plaid and Very Good Security at end of April, early May, I want to say, to go full-time on this. And we raised our seed round in June of 2020.‚Äù‚ÄîReed McGinley-Stempel, co-founderThe founders of Snowflake noticed looming challenges with companies relying on Hadoop:‚ÄúIn 2012, Thierry Cruanes and I were working at Oracle, and there was not a single day without discussions on how Hadoop [a developer of open-source computer software] was about to make [our work] completely obsolete. I even remember one day interviewing a young engineer who [was] so excited about Hadoop that he didn‚Äôt listen to anything we said about Oracle. We realized then that we were missing something.This made us think a lot about the future [of what we were doing]. Big data was taking over the world, and data warehouses as we knew them were having a really hard time competing. They were‚Äîand often still are‚Äîrigid, expensive, and difficult to use. At the same time, we were convinced that Hadoop was not a good solution either. Hadoop systems were really too hard to use for most‚Äîvery inefficient, slow, and missing key features that I would consider must-haves.This is the point we realized we could [build] a new type of data warehouse system . . . that would master the elasticity of the cloud. [What we built ran] 10 times faster than any other system for the same cost [and freed] users from any management tasks.‚Äù‚ÄîBenoit Dageville, co-founder, via Yahoo FinanceRamp‚Äôs founders found that credit card companies were solving the wrong problem, through working at Capital One and their previous startup:‚ÄúRamp is a continuation of a lot of things we‚Äôve been working on for a while. I had a company before this called Paribus, which helped people save money on things they were buying online. Within the year, we had about a million customers. Then we got what was a life-changing offer from Capital One to buy the company and went for it. So that was about 2016.We then spent the next two and a half years there scaling the company. We learned a lot more about how to turn data into savings at scale, and about all the ways that you can use fragments of data processes to automate processes, save people money, and save people time in various ways.We also ended up in the credit card division within Capital One, where we learned about how credit cards work, how rewards work, and all that. I just remember we talked to customers and asked them, ‚ÄòDid you want points, cash back, something different for rewards?‚Äô And what jumped out is people didn‚Äôt really want any of that. They wanted to be better-off. And we were just struck by this idea of rewards versus not spending that dollar in that first place.Pretty quickly we got obsessed with an idea: what if your card was smart enough to help you spend less? It actually might be better for the customer. You might be able to have a better shot at breaking out of the price-based competition.And fintech was becoming a thing then, where you could actually start these businesses relatively cheaply.There was only so much we could do inside of Capital One, and we helped what was Capital One Shopping become a thing and grow, and now it‚Äôs a big part of what they do, but we also concluded we couldn‚Äôt quite do what we were hoping to do inside of the company. So we left and then set out to build Ramp. That‚Äôs the story.‚Äù‚ÄîEric Glyman, co-founder and CEOPonder and probeCoda‚Äôs Shishir Mehrotra had been thinking about this idea for years:‚ÄúCoda started as a series of brainstorms. And at the time, I was reasonably happy at Google. I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere. But I had this long list of ideas of just stuff I‚Äôd like to see different in the world. This idea is one that‚Äôs been on my list for 20-plus years. And in some way or the other, I‚Äôve actually worked on it three different times.I had a good friend, Alex [DeNeui, eventual Coda co-founder], who was busy starting a company and had decided to pivot to a new idea. He asked me for help brainstorming what he should work on, and we ended up talking about the core ideas behind Coda‚Äîthat the line between docs and apps is artificial, and that it was time for a new blinking cursor. And in that process, I ended up basically falling in love with the idea again myself. Despite all reasonable indicators of why you shouldn‚Äôt start a company, I just couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it. And so I jumped in, and it was kind of funny, when I was talking to my wife: we were driving up to Napa for this wedding, and we‚Äôre in the car, and I was like, ‚ÄòI think I‚Äôm going to do this company with Alex.‚Äô And she says, ‚ÄòYeah, I already knew that.‚Äô And I said, ‚ÄòHow?‚Äô And she‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòBecause you took every free moment and you‚Äôre spending all that time with him on this idea.‚Äô‚Äù‚ÄîShishir Mehrotra, co-founder and CEOGusto‚Äôs three founders had secondhand experience with the challenges of running a small business and after ideating, focused on payroll as a great place to start:‚ÄúMy parents have a clothing store. It‚Äôs a small business, and I just grew up there in the store every day after school, going and organizing and selling and answering the phone calls and helping in the store. So I have this kind of small-business experience throughout my family. My grandfather has another store down the street. My aunt had another store. All in the same street in Haifa. So I really grew up around these small businesses, and one thing that‚Äôs really, really, really clear is that they don‚Äôt have the tools that big companies have in order to be successful. If you think about it, they are the ones who actually need the tools more than anyone else.So this idea of, what can you do to help this underserved group who need the help and what can you do to level the playing field for small business, is something that was always top of mind for me. Josh [Reeves], Eddie [Kim], and I [co-founders] all share a similar story with small businesses in our families. So when we got together, we wanted to build something.We kicked around a bunch of ideas for a couple of months. We had this massive whiteboard, and we kind of plotted a lot of different problems that we felt ourselves personally in our lives in different moments and different things, but very quickly we got focused on small businesses and then started talking with people.¬†We learned that a third of companies make payroll mistakes every year, and they get fines for it every year. That‚Äôs insane. The system is incredibly broken, so that‚Äôs where the idea came from.‚Äù‚ÄîTomer London, co-founder and CPOFor Census, Boris Jabes noticed a big pain point at his previous job and couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it:‚ÄúWhere the idea came from (eventually): I sold my previous startup (Meldium) to a company called LogMeIn, and I ended up working with a bunch of sales and marketing people there. Working with them was a struggle because they didn‚Äôt seem to have the same fountain of usage data that we did on the product and engineering side. That planted a seed in my mind. I thought, ‚ÄòThere really should just be one version of who is your user, what did they do, and what do we know about them?‚Äô My brain kept coming back to it, and my co-founders found it intriguing as well. But who was it for? In what form? That part was super-vague.We started to get together in the metaphorical basement, which was my house some days and my co-founder Anton [Vaynshtok]‚Äôs house other days. We kept asking, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs something that is customer data- or CRM-related?‚Äô For a couple of months, we worked on ideas in the domain, even going as far as building the prototype of a CRM for marketplaces.We realized it was better for us to say, ‚ÄòAll right, marketplace CRM, let‚Äôs do this.‚Äô We did it for two months. We didn‚Äôt want to raise on this right away. Instead let‚Äôs see if there ‚Äòis a there there.‚Äô We were looking for the combo of something we liked and excited potential users before building in earnest. A sensation that there‚Äôs a big problem that I would be willing to spend the next decade of my life pursuing.Looking back, sitting in a room and trying to come up with a great startup is really bad. We played that exercise for a month, and it‚Äôs just bad because we should have been talking to people who had problems. What I realized was all our ideas sounded great, but they were not connected to a specific user pain. For us, writing code, even though it‚Äôs not the most efficient use of time, helped us explore ideas best. Maybe we did it in a less efficient way; it forced us to talk to people and build a mental model of the real world.‚Äù‚ÄîBoris Jabes, co-founder of Censusüì£ Join Lenny‚Äôs Talent Collective üì£If you‚Äôre hiring, join Lenny‚Äôs Talent Collective to start getting weekly drops of world-class product and growth people who are passively open to new opportunities.

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeWelcome to part three of our series on how to kickstart and scale a B2B business:Part 1: How to come up with a great B2B startup ideaPart 2: How to validate your ideaPart 3: How to identify your ICP ‚Üê This postPart 4: How to find and win your first 10 customersPart 5: How to find product-market fitPart 6: How, and when, to hire your early teamPart 7: How to scale your growth engineLet‚Äôs jump right in.A huge thank-you to Akshay Kothari (COO of Notion), Ali Ghodsi (CEO of Databricks), Barry McCardel (CEO of Hex), Boris Jabes (CEO of Census), Calvin French-Owen (co-founder of Segment), Cameron Adams (co-founder and CPO of Canva), Christina Cacioppo (CEO of Vanta), David Hsu (CEO of Retool), Eilon Reshef (CPO of Gong), Eric Glyman (CEO of Ramp), Guy Podjarny (CEO of Snyk), Jori Lallo (co-founder of Linear), Julianna Lamb and Reed McGinley-Stempel (co-founders of Stytch), Keenan Rice (founding team), Mathilde Collin (CEO of Front), Rick Song (CEO of Persona), Rujul Zaparde and Lu Cheng (co-founders of Zip), Ryan Glasgow (CEO of Sprig), Shahed Khan (co-founder of Loom), Shishir Mehrotra (CEO of Coda), Sho Kuwamoto (VP of Product of Figma), Spenser Skates (co-founder and CEO of Amplitude), and Tomer London (co-founder and CPO of Gusto) for contributing to this series. Art by Natalie Harney.We‚Äôve so far spent all of our time finding and validating a problem, but surprisingly, many (perhaps most?) of the B2B companies I researched spent just as much time on picking the problem as they did on figuring out who to solve the problem for. When they didn‚Äôt do this, they often regretted it.‚ÄúWe did not think about ICP. I wish we did earlier on. It‚Äôs one of my biggest mistakes.‚Äù ‚ÄîMathilde Collin, co-founder and CEO of FrontIf you‚Äôve got a killer idea but you‚Äôre talking to the wrong people, you‚Äôll come away thinking your idea stinks, and give up. But the same idea pitched to different people can change everything.Below, I‚Äôll share a guide for nailing your ideal customer profile (ICP), dozens of stories of how founders identified their ICP, and as always, templates and tons of examples.A few of my biggest takeaways and surprises from this stepMost founders initially got their ICP wrong.Everyone landed on at least three attributes to describe their ICP.Data from outbound sales is the best signal for what‚Äôs working, versus leads from investors and friends.There are four common signs that you‚Äôre getting closer to your ICP:A significant increase in your conversion rateA significant increase in enthusiasmA much stronger desire to take action nowThe nod (see below)Initial ICPs for some of today‚Äôs biggest B2B companiesThrough my interviews, I‚Äôve gathered the initial ICPs of over a dozen startups. In the chart, and in the stories below, notice how most companies landed on exactly three attributes. Some had more, but no one had fewer. Also notice how specific these attributes get.How to identify your ICPTo identify your own ICP, go through the list below and take your best guess at picking the three most unique and important characteristics of your potential ideal customer (here‚Äôs a template to get you started):Company size (e.g. 1,000-5,000 employees)Job title (e.g. engineering manager, social media manager)Pain point you‚Äôre solving (e.g. compliance, internal transparency)Company‚Äôs unique way of working (e.g. design-driven, operationally heavy)Specific tech used (e.g. data warehouse, GitLab)Type of business (e.g. B2B SaaS, e-commerce)Price point (e.g. sells software that‚Äôs $10k ARR)Geo (e.g. urban centers, LatAm)A unique place the user spends time (e.g. Node.js community)Try to get super-specific and super-narrow with your ICP. Almost comically narrow.Gusto found the most success with six ICP attributes initially:‚ÄúWe started really, really, really, really, really, really, really narrow. Here‚Äôs how narrow:Only companies that are five or fewer employeesin Californiathat offer no benefitsthat have only salaried employees and no contractorsthat have any other deductionsand that agree to get paid eight days after they run payrollThat ended up being a specific set of companies. The reason they chose us, and why we went after them, is because of the value that we provided.¬†Slowly, we expanded to where we felt ready. Let‚Äôs begin to serve hourly employees. Okay, now let‚Äôs help businesses provide benefits. Okay, now let‚Äôs move to additional states. We knew we were ready to expand when we felt like, one, we were getting customer love and, two, we had sufficient engineering bandwidth to go and build the features and products without letting go of the previous customer audience.Today Gusto handles the bulk of what HR teams do, as well as some work of finance teams‚Äîpayroll, insurance, benefits, onboarding, performance reviews, state registrations, tax credits, and more‚Äîfor over 300,000 businesses with 1 to 500 employees in the U.S. and in 120 other countries. We‚Äôre 11 years in, but I still feel we are just getting started.‚Äù‚ÄîTomer London, co-founder and CPOThe founders of Gong landed on three highly nuanced attributes:‚ÄúWe tried to narrow it down as much as possible. We said we‚Äôre only going to sell to software companies that are:Selling in the U.S. in English, so we could start with just one language.Selling via video conferencing (it was Webex at the time), so we had the most amount of data to analyze.Selling software that is worth somewhere between $1,000 to $100,000, because beyond $100k, we assumed it was going to be a different sales cycle, and less than $1,000, it would be too transactional.There are probably 5,000 companies with this profile in the world. And exactly like the book Crossing the Chasm suggests, we thought, let‚Äôs get this small group working and get them excited. They would be the early adopters. We knew that we would understand their pain, and they‚Äôre typically advanced, so they would be early adopters.And then of course, over time, we went wider, adding phone calls versus video conferencing, and then different company categories and geographies.‚Äù‚ÄîEilon Reshef, co-founder and CPOAs did Snyk:‚ÄúOur initial target audience was a developer building with Node.js who was very security-conscious.This depth-first approach was really important to validate the solution on the path to product-market fit. A JavaScript developer won‚Äôt care if you support Golang or Rust. Nailing the narrow and deep use case before expanding wider was critical.The initial problem Snyk set out to solve was specific too: tracking and securing dependencies in the Node ecosystem. The community there would often discuss the inadequacies of the NPM dependency management capabilities. At the time, Node.js was gaining traction with increasing adoption in the enterprise, dedicated conferences, and the like, but it was still small enough that Snyk could meaningfully influence things. Here‚Äôs actually the first public showing of Snyk at Velocity Amsterdam in late 2015.‚Äù‚ÄîBen Williams, former VP of ProductAnd Looker:‚ÄúLooker was a technical product, created right at the very start of data moving to the cloud and large, event style data being treated as business critical for analysis. So in 2013-2015, our core ICP was technical data teams‚Äînot end users or business analysts‚Äîwho were starting to adopt cloud with large data sizes and complex analytical requirements AND the need to support a larger base on less technical end users within all functions of the company. These¬†data teams tended to look at themselves more as engineering vs analysts,¬†which aligned very well to our engineering first product design (code LookML, github built in, and all aspects of the product accessible via APIs). The companies tended to be startups with around 50-400 employees, with either engineering leading¬†data or the data team being very technical.‚Äù ‚ÄîKeenan Rice, founding teamDon‚Äôt stress if you can‚Äôt figure out your ICP for a while.Here‚Äôs Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO of Databricks (which is now worth over $30B) on their complete lack of an ICP early on:‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have an ICP at all. In those years at Berkeley, we just wanted to change the world, honestly. We just wanted to have impact. That was the most important thing. We worked with all kinds of different companies. We worked with a hospital that was using this stuff, and they were doing genomic stuff. We worked with folks that were using us to determine earthquake magnitudes using Twitter. These are completely different customers and different user profiles. So, no, we didn‚Äôt have an ideal customer profile. We were just trying out whoever wanted to use it.‚ÄùAnd Rick Song, co-founder and CEO of Persona:‚ÄúWe did the ICP exercise 17 times in the early days. So many times. Because at that time, all of the advice we ever got was like, ‚ÄòKnow your ICP.‚Äô So we kept trying to know who it was, and I also desperately did not want our ICP to just be startups. So we tried a lot. I think in earnest we never really had one, but we tried for sure.‚ÄùBut the sooner you figure out your ICP, the faster things will fall into place.‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think about ICPs whatsoever. However, looking back, that‚Äôs part of the reason PMF took so much time.‚Äù ‚ÄîBoris Jabes, co-founder and CEO of Census‚ÄúWe did not think about ICP. I wish we did earlier on. It‚Äôs one of my biggest mistakes.‚Äù ‚ÄîMathilde Collin, co-founder and CEO of FrontEventually, you‚Äôll be forced to figure it out.‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt focus on ICP at all, but once we did our public launch, we started getting a flood of different people coming in. Filtering through the leads spurred me into putting a much tighter definition around qualification for deals.‚Äù ‚ÄîBarry McCardel, co-founder and CEO of HexStart by paying attention to who gets most excited about what you‚Äôre building.For Canva, here‚Äôs Cameron Adams, co-founder and CPO, sharing their path to identifying an ICP:‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have any target persona until about six months into building the product. Through the conversations that we had with people, we began to see a certain segment really get excited about it. These social media managers, these people who were (a) figuring out what social media actually was, and then (b) having to scale this work across multiple clients and customers.In 2012, Instagram had only really started. Pinterest had just come out. This whole notion of visual social media was still emerging. And Canva was, I think, the perfect tool at the right time for people who were grappling with what visual social media was. The social media manager/blogger audience was definitely the perfect one for us to start building a community around‚Äîespecially freelancers, who were building their own social media management business. We gave them early demos of the product and then helped shape the feature set through their feedback. They were probably the ideal launch customer.‚ÄùFor Sprig, Ryan Glasgow, founder and CEO, on narrowing in on their unusual initial segment:‚ÄúWe found pretty early that our ICP was companies with millions of users. Being an early-stage startup selling to larger companies was actually one of our biggest early challenges. You have product-market fit for companies that are more difficult to sell to.Our first customer, Thunkable, had millions of users. Square and Robinhood‚Äîalso two of our early customers‚Äîhad millions of users. I was getting very strong pull with companies like these. The larger the user base, the more excited they were about Sprig. ‚Äã‚ÄãRobinhood agreed to a large contract even though we were early. They‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòWe love it. We‚Äôll install¬†tomorrow.‚Äô They installed it as we were building the first version, basically. So that told us to go after these larger companies, with millions of users.‚ÄùBe careful not to pattern-match too quickly.This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeShopify has always done things a bit differently. They‚Äôve been remote-friendly long before Covid, recently canceled all of their recurring meetings (and now even show how much each meeting is costing attendees!), and famously are on a mission to ‚Äúarm the rebels.‚ÄùThe business has been an unprecedented success story, too.¬†Shopify now¬†powers over 10% of all U.S. e-commerce, hosts a large swath of the world‚Äôs biggest e-commerce businesses, including Supreme, Glossier, Mattel, Vuori, Gymshark, and Allbirds, has processed over half a trillion dollars of GMV, and generates nearly $6B (!) of revenue per year.¬†Shopify is also 17 years old, with almost 10,000 employees, but continues to execute like a startup and launch innovative products like Sidekick (an AI business partner), immersive product description pages, and the world‚Äôs highest-converting checkout platform, Shop Pay.To learn from Shopify‚Äôs experience scaling and optimizing their product org, I sat down with Glen Coates, VP of Product, responsible for the core Shopify product‚Äîthe largest product team within the company.Here‚Äôs what stood out to me most about Shopify‚Äôs approach to product:Their CEO Tobi‚Äôs yearly themes, and how they inform every team‚Äôs planningTheir aversion to OKRsTheir homegrown task tracking system, called GSD‚ÄîGet Shit DoneTheir shift away from a GM structure, and their move from 10 business units down to twoTeams being structured around jobs to be doneTheir AAA framework for handling stakeholders‚ÄîAiming, Assembling, and AchievingTheir recursive internal mantra that ends with ‚ÄúThe third priority is never to reverse priorities one and two‚ÄùGlen is also going to be announcing a swath of product updates to the Shopify platform tomorrow morning as part of the Shopify Editions Summer ‚Äô23 launch. For more from Glen, follow him on LinkedIn and Twitter. For more stories of how the best product teams operate, don‚Äôt miss my interviews with Figma, Coda, Duolingo, Miro, Ramp, Notion, and Snowflake.How Shopify builds productGlen Coates, VP of Product1. How far out do you plan in detail, and how has that evolved over the years?Until very recently, Shopify had an annual planning process where we‚Äôd present plans to the CEO and Finance in August or September. We‚Äôd write these long docs, but unsurprisingly, they‚Äôd usually get torn up by about March. So planning became this charade of we‚Äôre going to do this insane planning thing, but we know it‚Äôs all just going to go sideways in three months. We all know how crazy it‚Äôs been out there; things are changing so fast all the time. People who think they can see a year out are mostly kidding themselves.Instead now, once a year, Tobi [Shopify‚Äôs founder and CEO] sets themes for the year. This year there were six that reflect top-level priorities. They‚Äôre always written from the point of view of the merchant. We try to imagine a Shopify merchant writing an email to a friend where they say, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs why I love Shopify, and here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm going to keep using it for my business.‚ÄùOne of the themes that Tobi added this year was ‚ÄúShopify keeps me on the cutting edge.‚Äù Which is an amorphous thing, ‚Äúthe cutting edge‚Äù‚Äîwhat does that mean? Is it developer tooling? Is it AI? Is it evolving regulations like ATT? Is it how I optimize my checkout for conversion? It could be any of that, which is the idea. We want merchants to focus on their business. We want them to think, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm just a guy trying to sell candles. Do I really want to have to learn everything about checkout conversion optimization? Do I really want to have to read white papers coming out of OpenAI, or can I trust that Shopify‚Äôs got me and I can just focus on my candles?‚Äù This year, especially with AI, that theme was such a focusing lens for us. We have to be on the bleeding edge so merchants don‚Äôt have to be.Once we have Tobi‚Äôs themes, one level lower within each top-level team (e.g. Core), we think about the ways we could measure our impact against those themes. We come up with what would end up being called an objective or something that smells a bit like an OKR (though we would never say that here).That turns into a rough six-month roadmap. This aligns with our twice-yearly releases, Shopify Editions, which are our big releases with hundreds of improvements, features, and products.We want to have very high confidence in what‚Äôs going to be shipping in the next Edition, and some idea of what will go in the one after that, but we don‚Äôt try to think too much further than that. Then every six weeks, teams come together and do their sprint-level detailed planning of what they are doing right now.¬†So that‚Äôs kind of the lay of the land in terms of planning. Themes once a year, which gets translated into a six-month plan, and then there are four six-week cycles inside each half.But again, things are changing so much right now. The world economy just went upside down last year, and that changed things. The world of AI appeared earlier this year, and that changed things. So I think we‚Äôve learned the hard way that the world doesn‚Äôt seem to be slowing down, and being able to react and not being married to the plan is actually the most important thing.2. You said you never use the word ‚ÄúOKR,‚Äù but let me ask you anyway‚Äîhave you used OKRs in some form, and how has that changed over the years?I‚Äôm not aware of us ever using OKRs formally at Shopify, but people end up using things that smell like them all the time. If I had to say why there is an aversion to them, I think it‚Äôs really two things. One, it‚Äôs part of the culture‚Äîthere‚Äôs a bit of an affinity for chaos and change that doesn‚Äôt embrace structured systems. In a sense, that‚Äôs just who Tobi is. Tobi is very truth-seeking in the sense of whatever the truth is, he just wants to go there, and systems and structures that stop him going to the truth are bad in and of themselves.If you look at companies like Google, Facebook‚Äîthings that are very aggregatory, very funnelly, very at-scale consumer products‚Äîthey‚Äôre often very metrics-oriented. A team owns a number, and the goal is to do whatever they have to do to make that number go up. I think Tobi just does not agree with that philosophy of product development and thinks that you end up with a lot of micro-optimizations of local maxima that may say you drove that number up, but the product just doesn‚Äôt feel good anymore. The product doesn‚Äôt fit well together, and it feels like one part is pushing me in one direction and the other part in another. You can‚Äôt really explain why that is until you find out that there were two teams inside the company who had different metrics they were optimizing for. That‚Äôs when you realize why the product is so weird and incohesive.On the other hand, there are some parts of Shopify where we do care a lot about metrics. A good example would be the Checkout team, who cares a lot about checkout conversion rate because there‚Äôs a one-to-one relationship between that and the money that our merchants make. We‚Äôre extremely focused on metrics when it comes to performance.We care a lot about the speed and quality of the product itself, but we‚Äôre not the kind of company that would deem something a failure or not approve something to go ahead just because you can‚Äôt put a metric on it. As an example, right now we‚Äôre working to significantly change the look and feel of the Shopify Admin [the seller dashboard] for no reason other than it‚Äôll look better and we think it‚Äôs the right thing to do. There‚Äôs zero metrics attached to it. The only thing that matters is that we come out the other side, look at it, and think: That‚Äôs rad. I‚Äôm psyched. Merchants are psyched. That‚Äôs it.Shopify Admin3. How do product/design review meetings work?Shopify has an internal system called GSD, which is a bit like Jira or a task management app, except it‚Äôs not really a task management app. It‚Äôs a project stakeholder reviewing tool. It stands for ‚ÄúGet Shit Done.‚Äù Every project that any team does goes in GSD, which has five phases of review:ProposalPrototypeBuildReleaseResultsHere‚Äôs what this looks like in an actual screenshot of GSD:We have a system called OK1 and OK2, and for any particular team there‚Äôs a front line of reviewers. On OK1s, it‚Äôs usually the directors from product, UX, engineering, and sometimes data who all have to sign off. And then it comes up to the senior leadership team (SLT), which we call OK2, which includes, again, product, UX, engineering, and data, who all have to sign off on it as well.It‚Äôs actually been really good practice for the PM team, because most of these reviews come with a short video from the PM explaining what the product or project is. I think it‚Äôs great practice for PMs to have to say, very concisely, ‚ÄúWhat is this thing? Why is it valuable? How does it work?‚Äù So they get a lot of practice storytelling in tight videos.Usually we do these reviews async and we trade comments. Sometimes, though, we set a meeting to talk synchronously when we know the topic will be super-controversial or it‚Äôs a big deal. We also have an office-hours rotation where if you need to get in for a 30-minute review for quick feedback on not very much notice, there‚Äôs a lever to pull.In terms of who makes the calls in product reviews, I generally think of it like this: product makes the call on should we do this at all, Engineering and UX essentially has the veto power on how we do it, and then at the end of the day, the PM has to put their body on the line for is this ready to ship. If they say yes and the thing‚Äôs garbage, then the PM has to wear it. That‚Äôs generally how that works.4. Are product and design part of the same org? And who do PMs ultimately report to? Has this changed over the years?Tobi is the head of R&D (and also CEO) at Shopify, and there are two people who report to him, who all the PMs report to. One of them is me and the other is Kaz. About half the PMs report to each of us.In my org, product, UX, marketing, ops, and partnerships all report up into me, and engineering and data have their own functional orgs separately. Under me, the reporting lines go functional. So the head of UX reports to me, and all of UX reports to her. I have a head of product marketing, and all of product marketing reports to her.In 2018 we had a GM structure, with about 10 GMs at Shopify, each of whom had all the functions for their business unit reporting to them. Then, about two and a half years ago, Tobi reorged the company from 10 divisions to two.The two divisions are:Core: What I run product for, which is what‚Äôs in the box when you buy Shopify‚Äîall the included features, the online store, checkout, and Admin.Merchant services: Think of it as the optional add-ons for Shopify, the point of sale, the payment processing, and the shipping labels. This also includes Shop‚Äîthe buyer-facing brand, the wallet, the package tracker, the shopping.There were many reasons for our move away from the GM structure, but one of the biggest reasons was because as the company grew and our product became wider, with lots of capabilities, the advantage we have versus your competitors is the breadth of the feature set‚Äîthe one-stop-shopness of your product. That value really starts to fall apart if the parts of the product don‚Äôt work well together and don‚Äôt seem like they were crafted from a single vision.This is the challenge that all big tech companies need to overcome. Can you tell how our org structure works by looking at the product? Can you see where the breaks are in the product or not? The best companies figure out how to make sure you can‚Äôt see the org chart through the product.This org structure that we‚Äôre in right now, it has downsides to it (e.g. very large teams that require a lot of centralized coordination), but the big upside is that the org chart and the actual product are very close to the same thing (e.g. we are respecting Conway‚Äôs law). This helps us deliver on what our merchants want: products that work well together and are all aimed in a single, consistent direction.5. Do you structure your teams around products, user types, user journey, outcomes, or something in between? Has this changed over the years?We‚Äôre structured essentially around jobs to be done. Within Core, we have 11 teams, and they are oriented around the main merchant jobs to be done. There are some that are obviously semi-standalone bits of the product, like the online store and the checkout. Once you get into the back end, we have a team called Merchandising, and the job to be done there is all about how to set up and sell products. There‚Äôs a team called Engage, which mainly focuses on marketing and customer engagement. There‚Äôs a team called Build, which manages the developer platform. There‚Äôs a team that manages the app ecosystem and all the dynamics around that.Part of the reason we focus teams around jobs to be done is to honor a promise Shopify tries to make and keep to its merchants. We never want merchants to bump into the ceiling that says, I love this product, but it‚Äôs not scaling to meet my needs. Now I have to go do the really painful thing of moving my entire business onto some other platform.We want teams to think about the whole spectrum. Everyone from my mom, if she wants to get started selling pottery tomorrow, all the way up to big brands like Supreme. We don‚Äôt want there to be any rough edges on that curve. As a merchant‚Äôs business gets bigger, we don‚Äôt want there to be a weird moment where Shopify flips into enterprise mode, where suddenly everything‚Äôs different. We want that to be a smooth curve all the way up, and we just need every team to care about that, so there is no ‚ÄúEnterprise Team‚Äù or ‚ÄúSmall Business Team‚Äù; each team needs to think about ‚Äúhello world through to IPO‚Äù for their features.In terms of jobs to be done, we don‚Äôt use the hardcore, capital JTBD framework or anything like that. There are gray areas around the edges of some of these things. There‚Äôs also a very big variance in the maturity between different jobs to be done within the company. Shopify is a world leader in checkout, for example. I think the next company to us in the world, in the landscape of checkouts on the internet, isn‚Äôt even close. We‚Äôre world leaders by a big margin. But then you take our Engage team, which builds the marketing tools and customer segmentation‚Äîthat‚Äôs really like a challenger, an upstart, versus a Salesforce Marketing Cloud or things that are much more steeped in those categories.6.

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeYou won‚Äôt succeed at growth long-term without deeply understanding and operationalizing attribution and incrementality. You risk endlessly spending money on seemingly good ideas that have exactly zero impact. Michael Kaminsky and Mike Taylor are two of the most experienced people I‚Äôve met on the dark arts of attribution and incrementality, and in today‚Äôs special guest post, they share the most in-depth and practical explanation I‚Äôve ever seen on the topic. It‚Äôs based on primary research into how 40+ top brands measure their marketing efforts, and I‚Äôm very excited to share it with you.Michael Kaminsky previously built the data team at the men‚Äôs shaving brand Harry‚Äôs and is the co-founder of marketing analytics firm Recast. Mike Taylor is the founder of the training platform Vexpower and previously built a 50-person growth marketing agency called Ladder.Many people encountering marketing measurement for the first time are surprised that it isn‚Äôt a solved problem.¬†‚ÄúI spend thousands of dollars on ads every day. I should be able to just pull a report to see what I got for it,‚Äù they might think. Unfortunately, even brands spending millions of dollars on advertising per month still struggle with measuring the impact of those dollars.The most important problem in marketing is this: If we spend an additional $1,000 on some marketing activity, how many additional sales would we drive? Marketers sometimes refer to this concept as ‚Äúincrementality.‚ÄùIncrementality is difficult to measure because we don‚Äôt get to observe the world where there‚Äôs no marketing activity, what a statistician might call the ‚Äúcounterfactual.‚Äù So even if we record some person clicking on an online advertisement and then making a purchase, we don‚Äôt know if this is correlation or causation: they might have made a purchase anyway, even without seeing the ad, because their friend told them about it, maybe, or because they already knew the brand.Navigating the labyrinth of marketing measurement is daunting at first glance, given the sheer variety of strategies available and the inherent complexity of the field. Although it‚Äôs true you can never achieve 100% clarity in marketing measurement, you‚Äôd be surprised at how close you can get by combining the right techniques.We‚Äôve built a database of 42 top consumer brands, such as Uber, Amazon, and Airbnb, providing unique insights into their measurement methods. These case studies present inventive and thoughtful approaches to marketing measurement and will help you shortcut your way to measurement success. Check it out here.Building on this research, below, we demystify the complexity of each measurement technique and provide a guide on how they operate and, most importantly, how you can implement each of these methods yourself. We‚Äôll show you exactly what the biggest consumer brands are using and what‚Äôs interesting about the way they‚Äôre using them.Source: our Marketing Measurement DatabaseHow do top consumer brands measure marketing?There are three main ways that brands measure marketing effectiveness:Digital tracking/multi-touch attribution (MTA): the default for online marketing, where browser cookies (or similar identifiers) allow advertisers to track the marketing source of their customersMarketing mix modeling (MMM): a statistical modeling technique that marketers use to determine which channels in their marketing mix deserve credit for sales, in order to reallocate budget to the highest-performing areasTesting/conversion lift studies (CLS): regularly run by marketers to validate what performance would look like if you switched a channel off, or scaled spend up or downOne growing trend we‚Äôve seen in the database we created was the theme of ‚Äútriangulation,‚Äù or using all three methods in conjunction with each other, to zero in on the truth of what‚Äôs working in marketing. Over 40% of the brands in the database are using at least two methods together, and around 20% use all three.¬†Each of these methods has strengths and weaknesses, but by triangulating the truth through combining multiple methods, you can get a more accurate measurement. The goal of triangulation is to determine how many of your sales are ‚Äúincremental,‚Äù meaning they wouldn‚Äôt have happened had you not invested in marketing. Using multiple measurement methods is like getting a second opinion after visiting the doctor: it can help you make better decisions.We‚Äôll run through each of the methods, highlight how consumer brands are using them, and then walk you through how to implement them in your own business. Then we‚Äôll cover how to combine them together through triangulation, so you can see how it works in practice for today‚Äôs top consumer brands.1. MTA: Multi-touch attribution/digital trackingDigital tracking is measuring marketing performance through UTM codes or tracking pixels. When tracking is discussed, ‚Äúlast touch‚Äù or ‚Äúlast click‚Äù attribution is always mentioned as the default form of measurement on the internet. Last touch is easy to implement and understand, but it‚Äôs flawed because it gives zero credit to ‚Äútouches‚Äù from other channels. Multi-touch attribution is a step more advanced, where you assign credit to different channels that a user interacted with (touched), based on predefined rules or a statistical model. The most consequential player in this space is Google and their measurement platform Google Analytics, which is installed on 60% of the top 100,000 websites. In addition to providing product analytics, GA is also used to measure the impact of marketing campaigns, which you can see in the source/medium report. We‚Äôll talk through the basics of setting up analytics below, but there are thousands of high-quality walkthroughs on using GA for attribution across the internet and YouTube.How this works technically is that the analytics tool or advertising platform drops a cookie (a unique identifier) in your browser so it can track your behavior across the website, and even across multiple websites or devices. Marketers add UTM codes to the end of the URLs (?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=abc) that they use in their campaigns, which record where users came from, and an ‚Äúevent‚Äù is logged whenever they do something valuable, like buy the product or sign up as a user.The major distinction within this space is how you assign credit across channels. Users tend to not come from just one source‚Äîthey may come back to the website multiple times via different channels before making a purchase or signing up. If you use the Google Analytics default ‚Äúlast touch‚Äù (assigning 100% of the credit to the last channel), you‚Äôll favor lower-funnel channels like (surprise, surprise) Google Ads, as opposed to upper-funnel channels like TikTok or Instagram.Outside of Google Analytics, there are a variety of vendors in this space, including Rockerbox, Northbeam, and Triple Whale, and many companies have implemented variations of this technology internally (my team helped build our internal version of this when I was at Harry‚Äôs).How consumer brands use multi-touch attributionThis is by far the most ubiquitous method, and because most new startups are online, it‚Äôs usually the predominant method they use to measure marketing in the early growth stages. Paradoxically, because it‚Äôs so common, there are comparatively fewer case studies available compared with the other methods. You can safely assume that everyone that sells products online is using this method in some form, because everyone has Google Analytics installed. The cases we‚Äôve included in the database are where they‚Äôre doing something interesting over and above the standard implementation of Google Analytics, like a custom model or unique approach.We found 17 instances of top brands talking about MTA in case studies, which is 40% of the brands featured, although it can be assumed that 100% of the brands use analytics and tracking pixels.Here are a few select quotes we found interesting, to highlight how top consumer brands are thinking about digital tracking/MTA:DoorDash: ‚ÄúCurrently, DoorDash uses a several-day last-touch attribution system for all digital marketing channels, which provides a good balance between a holistic view of conversions for most ads, and reasonable wait time for fully refreshed attribution performance.‚ÄùIt was surprising to me that a company as sophisticated as DoorDash would be using last-touch attribution, as detailed by Zhe Mai on their data science team. When I started in marketing over a decade ago, everyone was moving away from last-click, because it was universally agreed that it had obvious issues in biasing toward ‚Äúlower funnel‚Äù channels like Google Ads. Lower-funnel channels are more likely to be the last channel that a user interacts with before purchasing, but they shouldn‚Äôt get 100% of the credit! However, I think the fact that DoorDash is still using it highlights the pervasive nature of the last-click model: it‚Äôs simple and easy to interpret, as well as being the easiest to measure, so it‚Äôs still very commonly used across the industry, including at very sophisticated companies.Airbnb: ‚Äú‚ÄòSome teams look at MTA as a way to re-slice the pie,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòIt kind of makes one channel look better, or one team look better . . . but the pie doesn‚Äôt get bigger. The key is to use multi-touch attribution to make the pie bigger.‚Äô‚ÄùThis quote from Airbnb‚Äôs then‚Äìgrowth marketing lead Dmitry Stavitsky reminds us to not get sucked into the battle for budgets that attribution often comes down to. Different attribution models will make one channel look better than another, which can cause political infighting in siloed organizations. The goal should be to make marketing perform better, which ultimately leads to more success and financial reward for everyone working at the company.Uber: ‚ÄúWhen a user sees a social network ad, then searches ‚ÄòUber‚Äô on the web, clicks a search ad, and later signs up with Uber, it‚Äôs not fair to give all the credit to the search ad. Multi-touch attribution, another challenge Euclid tackles, involves looking at the impression level data, analyzing the complete user conversion journey, and then attributing the right weight of credit for each conversion to multiple channels.‚ÄùAs you might expect, there were several cases where fast-growing startups and larger enterprises saw fit to build a custom system, like the one Uber describes above. Companies like Uber pride themselves on their engineering and statistical talent and have the capability to manage such software in-house, adapted to their specific needs. One thing that was surprising was how we couldn‚Äôt find any examples of open source software, even among companies that have open-sourced their software for other methods like marketing mix modeling, like Uber has with their ‚ÄúOrbit‚Äù model. Perhaps MTA software isn‚Äôt as generalizable, or it could be that it‚Äôs seen as a ‚Äúsecret sauce‚Äù internally.How to set up tracking and analyticsDigital tracking, despite its issues, is a good starting point for brands that are primarily online. Start with a tracking plan, which details what you want to track and when that occurs. This can take the form of an Excel spreadsheet on up to a dynamically updated event tracking system that‚Äôs integrated with your software deployment process or tag manager, depending on your required level of sophistication.Once you‚Äôve agreed on your tracking plan, you should implement a tag manager, which lets you record data once and then push it to where you need it. Google provides a free product called Google Tag Manager, but there are also more sophisticated options like Segment that have a cost associated. The benefit of using a paid product is typically better collaboration and monitoring functionality, as well as ease of implementation.Now set up tracking pixels for each ad platform, and choose your analytics software. Google Analytics 4 is a good default for the web, although not everyone finds the interface to their liking. Mobile tracking is more complicated, because the Apple App Store is a barrier past which tracking parameters don‚Äôt cross. You have to use a link attribution service like AppsFlyer or Branch, which work with various methods to re-associate each install to the campaign they came from.Whatever stack you use, you‚Äôll find more advanced use cases necessitate setting up a data warehouse that pulls in all your analytics data, as well as your advertising spend data via a provider like Supermetrics or Funnel.io. Once everything is in one place you can build your own MTA models, with your own rules, as well as analyze the data in various reports through a data visualization tool like Looker or Tableau.2. MMM: Marketing mix modelingBefore we had the internet, how did marketers measure ads? You can‚Äôt click on a TV ad or tap on a newspaper to get to a website. In the 1960s a technique called marketing mix modeling (MMM), a subset of econometrics, was developed to measure the contribution of each channel to sales. More recently this technique has grown in popularity because it only needs aggregate data and therefore doesn‚Äôt have any privacy concerns. Meta‚Äôs open source Robyn library has made MMM more accessible, and a number of vendors (including Recast) have worked toward modernizing the technique.The method involves building an advanced statistical model, which correlates spikes and dips in sales with events and actions in marketing. So for example, if every time you increase paid advertising your organic sales rise, MMM can pick that up. This works independently of what your platform or analytics tool is telling you, so it‚Äôs used to fill the gaps in tracking and get a truer sense of what channels are really contributing to the bottom line. However, it can struggle with granularity at the campaign or creative level. Additionally, the results are very sensitive to the sophistication of the model, and it‚Äôs easy to get incorrect results if the model isn‚Äôt set up correctly.The big divide in methods is whether you use a traditional vendor like Nielsen or one of the more modern techniques. This is an important departure, because traditionally MMM is slow and expensive, meaning it‚Äôs usually run just once or twice a year, even by big brands. With more modern approaches, the models are more automated, and you can set up a data pipeline to update the model and optimize your marketing budget more regularly, like two to four times a month.How consumer brands use marketing mix modelingWe have the most case studies on this method because we built the database for a blog post on who‚Äôs talking about MMM in case studies. If we tried to collect case studies even five years ago, we would have been left with boring corporate drivel, but what‚Äôs normally a dry space has exploded since the advent of iOS 14, when Apple introduced the ability for users to say no to tracking. There has been a lot of innovation in the space, and, refreshingly, people seem eager to share what they‚Äôre doing, which has helped progress happen faster than it otherwise would.We found 35 instances of top brands talking about MMM in case studies, which is 82% of the brands featured. Here are a few select quotes we found interesting, to highlight how top consumer brands are thinking about MMM:Uber: ‚ÄúRecent consumer privacy initiatives (e.g., Apple‚Äôs announcement of no-IDFA 1 in iOS 14) further underscores the strategic importance of future-proofing any marketing measurement game plan with MMM.‚ÄùUber pins down precisely the reason for all of the recent momentum in this space. With a big gap in MTA tracking, marketers can no longer rely entirely on that method and have been branching out to techniques like MMM. Uber has been a large proponent of this in releasing their open source library Orbit, which is technically sophisticated but isn‚Äôt a full out-of-the-box MMM solution. Uber was just one of the companies in the database using multiple methods: 40% of these brands had at least two case studies recorded using different methods, or mentioned more than one method in the same case study.HelloFresh: ‚ÄúThe MMM is especially helpful in quantifying the impact of offline channels like television, billboards, or radio advertising, which are difficult to assess using digital measurement solutions.‚ÄùHelloFresh is one of the best-known companies among modern MMM proponents because it uses Bayesian techniques. Bayesian methods are helpful in the application of MMM because they allow for more complex specifications of the model while still capturing the underlying uncertainty. Many marketers tend to turn to MMM when they have a more complex marketing mix, like an advertiser that has multiple offline channels, for example. In fact, many of the clients we‚Äôve worked with came to use it right around the time they decided to branch out into offline channels like TV or billboards, because of course you can‚Äôt measure these methods with digital tracking‚Äîyou can‚Äôt click on a TV ad or billboard.Resident (Nectar mattresses): ‚ÄúThe optimization efforts have achieved a 20% increase in revenue with the same blended cost per acquisition. Five days to implement the Robyn model (compared to five working months to implement its in-house model).‚ÄùThe case study from Resident, owner of the Nectar mattress brand, highlights both the benefit of MMM and the positive contribution of all of this investment in modern techniques. Done well, MMM should help you bring down your cost of acquisition or improve your return on investment, through helping you reallocate your budget. It‚Äôs easy for analysts to lose sight of that and fail to communicate the ultimate goal to the rest of the business, who get lost in the statistics. Meta‚Äôs open source library, Robyn, has democratized MMM for companies that didn‚Äôt have a data science team to custom build their models, and it does a fairly good job out of the box. It‚Äôs usually the first port of call for smaller clients, and often the people we work with have at least tested it on the path toward more sophisticated techniques. If you‚Äôre paying for a vendor to build your MMM, or working on your own custom solution, we recommend testing it head-to-head against Robyn to establish a good baseline for accuracy and performance.How to build a marketing mix modelWhen it comes to building your first MMM, you should buckle up for a three- to six-month project if you have a complicated set of marketing activities to model. Data collection and formatting might take you 40% to 60% of this time, particularly if you don‚Äôt have your house in order already. Tech startups that already have all their data in a data warehouse will accelerate through this phase, whereas legacy businesses that operate in silos might take a significant amount of time. Beginning this project might also spawn other projects to clean up your data or collect more of it, depending on what you find when you go looking for the data you need.We‚Äôve found you can bring that timeline down to a couple of weeks when working with a vendor who has automated all the data collection, reporting, and forecasting. On the lower end this can be as simple as using Supermetrics or Funnel.io to dump your data into a Google spreadsheet, but on the higher end it could mean working with a vendor that has built a data warehouse and all the necessary connectors to the main marketing channels and analytics platforms, like we have done at Recast.¬†If you plan to build a model in-house, either Meta‚Äôs Robyn or Google‚Äôs LightweightMMM would be a good solid base, but they obviously have their limitations and will need some customization for your use case. Uber‚Äôs Orbit uses time-varying coefficients, which means the performance of marketing can change over time in their models, which we think is essential and, as such, built our models around this principle. Remarkably, most MMMs assume marketing never improves or changes in performance, even around important seasonal trends or economic events.If you plan to go for a completely custom build, plan in anything from an additional three months to two years, which is how long it took us to exit our R&D phase at Recast. MMM is a hard statistical problem to solve, and is unusually unsuitable for solving through modern machine learning techniques. MMM has the joint goal of being accurate but also explainable: a model is useless if it can‚Äôt tell you which channel contributed to sales historically, or help you forecast out what to spend in each channel.3. CLS: Conversion lift studiesMost people don‚Äôt know that marketers were using randomized controlled trials before the first double-blind study was published in medicine! Claude Hopkins, who wrote the book Scientific Advertising in 1923, would regularly split his mailing list into multiple groups that would each get a different message so he could see what message worked best. Conversion lift studies (CLS) are still the gold standard of how advertising is measured, and serve as definitive proof of incrementality (how many of your sales wouldn‚Äôt have happened without ads).Nowadays the power of split testing, or A/B testing, is commonly known among marketers and product managers for landing page and creative testing, but it can also be used for marketing measurement. It works by dividing the audience into randomly assigned groups and then turning off advertising to one of those groups to calculate the difference. There are more advanced statistical calculations that can be run to determine group selection and estimate what would have happened had you not turned off ads. ‚ÄúGeo lift‚Äù isn‚Äôt immune from problems, and it can be complicated and expensive to set up and run these experiments, but it‚Äôs a solid technique.There are two forms of testing that are most useful in determining the overall effectiveness of marketing. Many ad platforms, like Meta and Google, allow you to run CLS on the platform, where they define the parameters of the test and are responsible for dividing the audience. Even without a platform, you can run a geo-level experiment where you might turn off ads in five U.S. states and calculate the difference, using statistics to establish causal effects.How consumer brands use conversion lift studiesThere were relatively fewer case studies in this domain, perhaps because there aren‚Äôt as many vendors that offer it. Usually, in our experience, lift studies are done in-house using an open source library like Meta‚Äôs GeoLift model or with some custom code written by the data-science team. There are also platform lift tests, which are much more commonly run by large advertisers, but, again, this is a standard feature (only in some cases do you need to go through your platform representative), so not many people write publicly about it.In the database we found 16 instances of top brands talking about experiments/CLS in case studies, which is 38% of the brands featured. Here are a few select quotes we found interesting, to highlight how top consumer brands are thinking about this method:Netflix: ‚ÄúUsually we‚Äôd like to run a classic individual-level randomized experiment, but randomizing which individuals see a billboard ad, as an example, is not possible. However, while we cannot randomly assign individuals, we can randomly choose some cities within which to show billboards and other cities to leave without.‚ÄùNetflix makes the case for geo-testing, where you divide up your audience into geographical regions like cities, counties, or states, and turn off ads in some of those regions, to determine how many incremental sales the ads drove. This is often the only feasible way to run an experiment for many channels, because randomly assigning some part of the audience to not see ads is impossible or impractical. The benefit of this approach is that it works independently of what the platform offers, which means you don‚Äôt have to trust their in-platform lift testing methodology and can confirm the value of their channel for yourself.Uber: ‚ÄúWe measure a 6.57% decrease of conversions (statistically significant) when UAC spend is suspended. To our knowledge, our work is one of the earliest studies that successfully measures the incremental value of UAC with controlled experiments.‚ÄùThis case study from Uber is the bread and butter of experimentation: determining the incremental value of a channel. Knowing that 6.57% of their conversions were attributable to UAC (Google‚Äôs Universal App Campaigns) helps them clearly calculate the return on investment for that channel and decide if they want to invest more or cut spend and re-attribute elsewhere. Experiments like this are important to Uber because they were the victim of a $100 million fraud in ad spend, ultimately suing their programmatic display vendor. The reports all looked great, but when they ran the incrementality numbers, they noticed that the conversions would have happened anyway, which tipped them off to the fact they were spending millions of dollars advertising to bots instead of real people.McDonald‚Äôs: ‚ÄúIn 2019, we used the Meta Marketing API to build a geo-test solution switching on and off Meta advertising for McDonald‚Äôs. We used the aggregated output to validate our MMM model, grounding the contribution to Meta‚Äôs advertising into the causal contribution identified in the experiment.‚ÄùThis is becoming a common thread: using the results of one method to calibrate another. Using the results of a conversion lift study based on geographical regions helped McDonald‚Äôs build a more accurate marketing mix model, by establishing a ground truth with which to measure the model against. This can be really useful to keep the modeling process honest, because there are usually hundreds of potential models that fit the data. It‚Äôs important to bear in mind that incrementality tests are just a snapshot of a point in time. You learn the incrementality of the channel at that point when you run the test, but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily generalize over time. I‚Äôve seen some scenarios where a channel that was found to be 90% incremental previously ended up being less than 20% incremental only four months later, because the ads team unknowingly dropped the setting that excludes existing customers.How to run a conversion lift studyMost often, the first experience with lift studies is in-platform, for example using Meta‚Äôs native solution or the equivalent offered by Google. However, this only tells you about one channel, and not every channel offers this option. Many smaller digital channels outside of Google and Meta don‚Äôt offer in-platform incrementality tests, or they do offer it, but only if you‚Äôre a big spender and you insist on it. In many channels it's just not possible technically‚Äîfor example, you can‚Äôt de-rank your website from Google search results for some users but not others‚Äîto test whether ranking makes a difference to traffic.If you don‚Äôt trust the platform to grade their own homework, or want to test a channel that doesn‚Äôt offer in-platform testing, the most common method is a geo-region test. If you‚Äôre planning to run these experiments in-house, Meta‚Äôs team open-sourced GeoLift, a library that does the calculations and estimates a ‚Äúsynthetic control‚Äù (a weighted combination of similar regions), so that you can be sure you‚Äôre running a statistically valid experiment.¬†Various factors can be adjusted in your experiments, so, for example, you can turn off some channels but not others, or run them in various combinations, to establish how they interact with each other. One of our favorite techniques is to run scale tests, where you increase spend in graduated steps in some regions but not in others, in order to see where a channel hits saturation due to diminishing returns. This can tell you how much headroom you have to expand investment in the channel, and at what point it gets too expensive to invest more in.¬†How to get these methods working together¬†This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

If you‚Äôre currently interviewing, or plan to, this will change your life.For more, follow Coach Erika on LinkedIn, Twitter, and definitely check out her newsletter, The Career Whispers.Today I‚Äôm going to teach you how to pass any first-round interview in tech, even in a difficult talent market.I‚Äôve coached over 200 people in tech job searches (from APMs to eng managers to chief product officers, and everything in between). 93% percent of them landed jobs at Google, Meta, Uber, Airbnb, Stripe, or a similar top-tier tech company‚Äîwithout burning themselves to the ground endlessly preparing, or winging it and hoping for the best.I‚Äôm not a recruiter or HR leader. I‚Äôm an engineer and product manager, like many of you. In 2013, I landed my first job in Big Tech (at Google), and my career took off. Over the next 10 years, I moved into management and leadership roles, where I learned about how the sausage is made when it comes to interviews, offers, and talent assessments. Now, I‚Äôm a chief product officer, and¬†I moonlight as a career coach to help people unlock outsized career opportunities.My goal in sharing this Minimum Viable Interview Prep (MVIP) process is to arm you with the employer and interviewer perspective so that you can build confidence in your job search. I‚Äôm passionate about helping people with job searching because I know how much the right role can set you up for success in your career and financial life.Why employers do first-round interviewsFirst rounds are designed to filter out candidates who are unlikely to be a contender for an offer.Interviews are very expensive for employers (time, coordination, resources, opportunity cost). The singular goal of a first-round interview (from the employer‚Äôs perspective) is to determine if they want to invest in additional interviews with that candidate.How first-round interviews fit in the broader interview processBy the time you get to a first-round interview, you likely have already:Applied or been referred by an employeeSpoken to a recruiter or HR representative (phone screen)If you pass a first-round interview, the next step is often second rounds (another single interview), or even final-round interviews (three to six interviews back-to-back in one day or split over two days).The logisticsMost first-round interviews in tech are:30 minutes to 1 houron the phone or via video chatwith just one interviewer (not panel-style)conducted by a hiring manager, peer, or another person familiar with the roleThe standard time breakdown is typically:10% intro70% questions from the interviewer20% questions from the candidateFor a 45-minute interview, this looks like:3-5 minutes intros35 minutes questions from the interviewer5-7 minutes questions from the candidateMost first-round interviews stick to behavioral questions, i.e. questions that ask you about your own experiences, like ‚ÄúTell me about a time when you had a conflict with a colleague.‚ÄùGenerally, the first-round interview scope isn‚Äôt comprehensive. Employers aren‚Äôt going to be able to fully assess your fit for the role/team/company in less than 60 minutes!¬†Note: It‚Äôs a bit of a hot take, but I advise people to run if a company gives you an offer at this stage. (Just imagine how undiscerning they will have been with your future peers as well!)¬†On-the-spot offers in tech are rare, but all of us who build products know that systems fail at the edge cases‚Äîfew of you will get an offer in your first or second interview (and this is a good thing), but my advice is to walk away (or at least ask a lot of questions) if you get an offer on the spot.Common first-round interview question themes:Your resume and online content (including expertise posts and thought leadership)1-2 core competencies for the role (usually the P0s, not the P2s and P3s)Culture fit (these can be direct questions, e.g. ‚ÄúDescribe your ideal team culture,‚Äù or indirect assessments based on your behavior, mannerisms, or speech: what you say and how you say it)Special casesAre you a software engineer or data scientist? Your first-round interview will likely be a technical screen (coding or system design or experimental design). Note that the way you problem-solve and communicate are assessed, not just whether you arrive at a working solution!Are you a PM? Your first-round interview will likely focus more on product design, product sense/execution, and data analysis or estimation questions (PM core competencies).How to prepareIt‚Äôs time to talk about tactics for interview preparation.¬†Now is a good time to introduce Minimum Viable Interview Prep (MVIP). Below is a quick summary of the approach, with links to dive deeper before your next interview.The How, part 1: Get your (career) story straightKnow your digital footprintAnything and everything on the open web is fair game for an employer or interviewer to read and bring up in your interviews. This includes LinkedIn posts, Medium or Substack articles, GitHub, tweets, old blog posts, quotes in newspaper articles, etc.¬†A useful to-do list:Know what‚Äôs out there (about you or authored by you)Assess whether it fits how you‚Äôd like to present yourselfModify as needed to represent yourself as you‚Äôd preferFor example: If I were looking for a data science role, I‚Äôd want to spend a few hours organizing the Python code in my public machine learning GitHub repo. It was written under timeline duress (!) and needs some refactoring so I can put my best foot forward if someone skims the code.Know your (strategic and compelling) reasons for wanting this roleWhen you go for an interview, you should assume the company is assessing at least two to four other people for the role. Like any competition, you want to get out front quickly and take the lead. One way to do this is to be clear and concise about why you want this job.Generally, avoid reasons that revolve around work hygiene or professional conveniences, e.g. compensation, short commute, remote work. This advice may seem obvious, but yes, people bring these up often. Don‚Äôt be one of them.Avoid reasons that sound like complaints about your current or past employer, e.g. ‚Äúbetter company,‚Äù ‚Äúsmarter colleagues,‚Äù ‚Äúkinder boss,‚Äù ‚Äúescaping a toxic culture.‚ÄùStick to reasons that:¬†convey what you bring to the role (the compelling ones for the employer)explain how this role will accelerate your career (the strategic reasons)You don‚Äôt need 10 reasons. One single, decisive reason will do: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent eight years building large-scale, distributed systems for products used by about 100 million users. An exciting and progressive step for me would be to build similar technologies for the billion-user scale.‚ÄùKnow the role (map it)One of the oldest sales tricks in the book is a tactic called ‚Äúmirroring.‚Äù It‚Äôs a psychological concept that involves physically and verbally doing what the other person is doing. People are comfortable with their own mannerisms. When you mirror them, you make them comfortable and subconsciously make them feel you are like them.You can use mirroring in your interview process. How? Use their language when describing your experiences.How to do this (interview pre-work)Paste the job description into a doc, then highlight keywords and concepts.Put the keywords into a table (one row per keyword or concept). Then add a column to the right. Here‚Äôs a template to get you started.In the right column, write down parts of your experience that map to that concept.Read this before your interview.In the interview, when you talk about your experience (right column), use their language (left column) to explain what you did.Example:The job description with key concepts highlightedJob description keywords mapped to your experienceIn the interview, use their language when you describe your experiences: ‚ÄúWhen I was on-call for a multi-datacenter system, I diagnosed and resolved a major technical issue and ensured services were restored. Later, I wrote automation to programmatically detect this type of issue in the future.‚ÄùThe more familiar the interviewer is with the job description and the role requirements, the more effective this technique will be (at subconsciously reinforcing your fit for the role).The How, part 2: Walk down memory laneThe vast majority of interview questions will ask you to dive into your past experiences and describe how you handled a specific situation. When you‚Äôve been working for five or more years, it can be really tough to index your memory and pull out the perfect example on a dime.(By the way: It‚Äôs not you. It‚Äôs everyone. We all struggle with this. It‚Äôs a neurobiological limitation with the way our brains store memories.)Writing down the answers to hundreds of behavioral questions is a common way I see candidates try to remember all the things they‚Äôve accomplished. This is exhausting and can actually overload your brain and cause you to freeze up or even ‚Äúblackout‚Äù in an interview.To avoid burnout and get better results, I instead coach candidates to pick three to five recent major projects in their careers, and then remember every single detail they can recall about those projects, for example:Example prompts to walk down memory lane and reposition memories for better interview storytelling. See the references section at the end for a detailed walkthrough and example.Writing all of this down will help you reference the details before future interviews (especially if you have an extended job search, as is common in difficult talent markets like the one we‚Äôre experiencing this year).When you are asked about past work experiences, your brain will more easily pull from one of these projects. And you‚Äôll be able to provide high-resolution details on the context, what happened, and the results (quantified!).What counts as major?Large and complex, ideally.Large in scope (important to the business, strategic, involves lots of stakeholders, significant revenue or user impact)Complex (in terms of the stakeholders, core team, tech, timeline, resources, etc.)Why large and complex?¬†Demonstrating your maximum capacity will enable you to validate your ability to handle larger scope and responsibilities, which typically correspond to higher titles and compensation (if that matters to you).What counts as recent?Ideally the past two to four years. The two-to-four-year guideline is largely pragmatic. Memories aren‚Äôt stable, and they do experience neural ‚Äúbit rot‚Äù‚Äîwhich means even if you resurrect those memories, it‚Äôll be hard to recall the details.A second reason to aim for recent projects: Assuming your career has been growing, recent projects will likely also be larger and more significant (see: Why large and complex?).The How, part 3: Learn the behavioral frameworks, and never again sweat an interview questionMost people know that interviews are chock-full of behavioral questions, and most candidates either know (or quickly research) the STAR method during their interview prep.A refresher on the STAR method if you‚Äôre unfamiliar or haven‚Äôt interviewed recently:S: Situation‚Äîwhat was happening at the time (context)T: Tasks‚Äîwhat you were responsible forA: Action‚Äîwhat you did to solve the problem and deliver outcomesR: Result‚Äîthe impact of your actionsA recent tweet where I walked through the STAR method in detail and my unique improvements that demonstrate your growth mindset.Simple, right? Yet there‚Äôs more to it‚Ä¶Behavioral interview questions were invented 50 years ago, in the 1970s. Studies quickly found that these questions were 55% more effective at predicting on-the-job performance than the prevailing interview questions at the time. They took the business world by storm and became the de facto interview technique. Today, they are used extensively in tech interviews (by my estimate, more than 60% of interview questions are behavioral). Amazon actually sends candidates a STAR primer before their interviews!But it‚Äôs been half a century, and behavioral question formats have evolved. Your approach to answering them needs to evolve too.In tech, I see 3 main formats for behavioral questions:Pure ‚Äî ‚ÄúTell me about a time when‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†Situational ‚Äî ‚ÄúPut yourself in this situation; what would you do?‚ÄùTheoretical ‚Äî ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your general approach to doing X?‚ÄùAll of them ask what you have done or what you would do (in a situation) or what you generally do, to extrapolate and predict on-the-job performance. To interview effectively in tech today, you need to know how to answer each of these questions.¬†Below is a primer you can use to answer each type of behavioral interview question.Pure (70% of behavioral questions)Why they ask: Understanding how you‚Äôve behaved in the past can be used to extrapolate how you might perform in this roleWhat they ask: Share a specific career experience from the pastHow to respond: Start with STAR, then add two improvements. First, what you learned. Then, how you evolved your approach and incorporated these learnings in a future situation. (I call this STAR++)ExampleTell me about a time you had to work quickly to deliver a result.S: Start with context (strategic, business, project)Answer: Situation‚ÄúI was at a pre-IPO company in an eng leadership role. To prep for the IPO, we needed to update compensation bands and ensure all 250 engineers were being paid fairly.This was complex, because comp is a charged issue and I only had six weeks to deliver.‚ÄùT: Explain your role in the situationAnswer: Tasks‚ÄúThe project was driven by HR. They were doing the analysis and proposing the new comp bands.My job was to test the new comp bands against the current comp for every engineer in the company and ensure that the new comp bands were both equitable and attractive for current and future talent.‚ÄùA: Share the actions you took to ensure successAnswer: Actions‚ÄúAs HR pushed new draft engineering comp bands:I analyzed them against the career ladder to detect issuesI verified that no employee would have a compensation regressionI identified and corrected errorsI messaged the comp changes to the 250-person eng team‚ÄùR: Quantify the results (from a short- and longer-term strategic perspective)Answer: Results‚ÄúI rolled out the engineering comp bands on time.Engineers were happy with the changes (no comp regressions, most got pay increases)Finance could accurately forecast headcount spending with the new compComp was ready for IPO üéâ‚ÄùThen add the growth mindset (the ++ in STAR++)+ (learnings): Expose what you learnedAnswer: + (learnings)‚ÄúThere was an uncaught error in the Sr. Mgr comp bands that resulted in above-market comp for some employees.The project goal just set a minimum, no maximum, so I didn‚Äôt look for outliers. I learned to ask for success criteria in a range, not just the target!‚Äù+ (future improvements): Share how you‚Äôve adapted your approach for future projects (given the learnings)Answer: + (future improvements)‚ÄúI recently ran a project to reduce our platform web page load times. Initially the executive sponsor set the success criteria as loading in less than 1 second. I inquired about the success criteria as a range and was able to set a clearer target: 0.3 to 1 second.Setting the success criteria as a range saved us from major misalignment that would have doubled the development efforts and led to exorbitant ongoing server costs.‚ÄùTry this at home! (with these handy practice questions):‚ÄúTell me about a time when you failed.‚Äù‚ÄúWalk me through an experience where you had to give difficult feedback.‚Äù‚ÄúShare an example of an excellent team culture that you were part of.‚Äùüí° Tip: If you‚Äôre in a time pinch, focus your prep time on pure behavioral questions (70% of all behavioral questions).Theoretical (20% of behavioral questions)Why they ask: Learning how you generally go about doing tasks or activities that are central to the roleWhat they ask: Your general approach to a core element of the role and your craftHow to respond:Outline your general approach (3-5 elements)Describe your approach for each in detail¬†End with an example (use STAR) that exemplifies your use of this frameworkExampleHow do you give feedback (as a manager)?Answer, part 1: Outline your general approach (3-5 elements)Three major considerations:Behavior ‚Äî what specific behavior am I trying to change?Messaging ‚Äî how can I give the feedback in the way it will be most effectively heard, understood, and actioned?Alignment ‚Äî how can I ensure that me and the team member are in agreement with the need to change, how we‚Äôre going to measure success, and how we‚Äôll check in to monitor the change?Answer, part 2: Describe your approach for each in detail¬†(with tactics)For each of these major considerations, here‚Äôs how I would specifically go about doing this:BehaviorWhat is the specific behavior that needs to change?What are the impacts of that behavior (on the individual, team, project, product, business, or company strategy)?If this specific behavior changes, what will improve (for the individual, team, project, product, business)?MessagingDirectWhat do I need them to hear?What words must be said?How will I know if they understand the message?EmpatheticHow can I respect the vulnerability of the situation?What do I need them to not hear? (avoid creating defensive behavior)What words should I avoid?AlignmentWhat questions can I ask to ensure they understood?What questions can I ask to ensure we‚Äôre aligned on the problem and what needs to change?What questions can I ask to collaborate on a definition of what success looks like so we know if the feedback is being actioned?Create a check-in plan (activities, frequency)"Answer, part 3: End with an example (use STAR) that exemplifies your use of this frameworkSituational Context and Tasks:‚ÄúAt Google, I managed a team of technical program managers (TPMs) who owned critical, strategic programs for the organization. One of the TPMs on the team was chatty and often made other team members late to meetings or distracted with their work. Their intent was to build relationships at work, but the reality was that other team members got distracted, anxious, and even stressed by my team member‚Äôs chattiness.‚ÄùActions:‚ÄúI came up with a plan, first by clearly identifying the behavior that needed to change. Because the problem was caused by a personality trait, it was important to isolate the specific problem being caused and the specific action that needed to change. In this case, it was having personal chats with colleagues during core work hours.Next, I needed to plan the messaging, to avoid making the person feel attacked or defensive. I decided to express the problem in terms of how it impacted both their project success and their teammate‚Äôs stress levels. Then, I planned some alignment questions to ensure we were in agreement on the problem, the change that needed to happen, and how we were going to hold ourselves accountable to measure success and check in.Then, I had the conversation with the team member.‚ÄùResults:‚ÄúThe team member immediately acknowledged the issue, since they knew themselves to be chatty, and thanked me for bringing the impacts (to others) to their attention. We aligned quickly on a plan to check in monthly, and the team member agreed to let me periodically probe the team to ensure that the change was taking place.Within two months, the issue was resolved. Team members felt less stressed, more focused, and more confident in the team dynamics. My team member continued to connect with colleagues at lunch and after work hours, to build meaningful relationships (which was their personality). Today, that team member is a successful TPM leader at Google and thanked me for helping them see this blindspot.‚ÄùTry this at home! (with these handy practice questions):‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your general approach to building respectful, delightful products?‚Äù‚ÄúHow do you go about building team culture?‚Äù‚ÄúHow do you give feedback?‚ÄùSituational (10% of behavioral questions)Why they ask: To see how you gather and synthesize information to create a reasonable path forward using strong judgmentWhat they ask: In a hypothetical (but realistic) work situation, tell me what you‚Äôd doHow to respond:Ask clarifying questions to fully understand the situation (enough that you can create an action plan)¬†State any assumptions you‚Äôre making¬†Outline a plan, then expand with specific details on your approach¬†Check in with the interviewer to see if you missed anything or if they want to dive deeper into a given area¬†SummarizeExampleYou found out the project you are leading is being canceled. What do you do?Answer, part 1: Ask clarifying questionsSome clarifying questions (and answers from interviewer):what stage of completion is the project (beginning / middle / end)? (end)how long has the team been working on this? (a while)how important is this project to the team (strategic priority)? (it‚Äôs the only work that the team has on its plate)how many people are working on this? (30)any users / clients / customers affected? (no)other internal teams affected? (yes)Answer, part 2: State your assumptionsI‚Äôm going to assume:there‚Äôs an open dialogue with the leadership teamthere are data available to confirm the validity of this decisionthe team doesn‚Äôt know yetthe team is not going to be fired, laid off, or otherwise disbanded (thus will be available to work on other high priority efforts)Answer, part 3: Outline a plan, then expand (3-5 items)Three major considerations:Trust but Validate the Decision (before communicating further)Meet with exec leadersAsk about assumptions(if I don‚Äôt agree with the conclusion, gather data, and present it back with alternative solutions)(if agreed on the conclusion, move forward)Team (communication, landing the change, setting the team up for future success)make a wind-down plancommunication plan ‚Äî crisp, clear, direct, state assumptions, preemptively address likely FAQsannounce to everyone at once, in personmake information available in written, transparent, discoverable formataddress individual concerns, leverage managers (align with them)develop a future plan for the team (replace the strategy void)Internal customers (communication, partnering to problem solve & land the change)communication plan ‚Äî crisp, clear, direct, state assumptions, preemptively address likely FAQsannounce in person with each internal customermake information available in written, transparent, discoverable format, add FAQs as they come inpartner to problem-solve and ensure they land on their feet.Answer, part 4: Check back with the interviewer‚ÄúDid I miss any key steps from your perspective, or is there any area you‚Äôd like to dive into together?‚ÄùAnswer, part 5: Summarize the question prompt and key items‚ÄúYou asked me what I would do if I found out that a project that I was leading was canceled. I walked you through my process of validating the decision, then creating a plan, communicating to both the team working on the project and the internal customers of the project, then my goal to land the wind-down effort in a timely and effective manner, and ensure the future direction and productivity of the team.‚ÄùTry this at home! (with these handy practice questions):‚ÄúYou just started on a new team. Tell me your approach to ramping up.‚Äù‚ÄúYou just found out the project you are leading is being canceled. What do you do?‚Äù‚ÄúYou get a report that your product is crashing. What do you do?‚Äùüí° Want more examples? Check out the reference posts at the end for detailed walk-throughs for each of these behavioral question types.The How, part 4: Formulate high-signal questions (to get interviewers thinking)If you‚Äôre a running fan, you know that the Boston Marathon is often won or lost at one single point in the race‚ÄîHeartbreak Hill‚Äîincluding in this year‚Äôs marathon.The Boston Marathon‚Äôs Heartbreak Hill is so tough that neighbors at the top of the hill marked it with this wooden sculpture.Interviews are often won or lost by the questions you ask the interviewer at the end. Half of the battle is preparing well and showing up to answer the interviewer‚Äôs questions; the other half is asking them questions that get them thinking (and make you stand out).We all want to work with exceptional colleagues who work hard, get things done, and push us to greater heights. Interviewers are exactly the same. You need to get them thinking (in a good way).Formulate questions that are interesting and thoughtful, and you‚Äôll end the interview on a high note and possibly put yourself in the lead.3 steps to formulating great questions for interviewers:Define the signals you need (to determine if you want the role). Bring questions whose answers are actually important to you. Anyone can grab a question from a listicle. Only you can ask questions that will answer your open questions about the role.Do your research. On the industry, company, competitive landscape, team/product, and even the interviewers. Look for trends, competitive landscape changes, and news. You can find these on consulting firm dossiers, VC thought-leadership white papers, the company‚Äôs website, Yahoo Finance, and competitive landscape engines like G2 and Capterra.Formulate questions that highlight that you‚Äôve done your homework and that give you the signal you want.You can do this in an hour or two, and it‚Äôs well worth the investment. You can even reuse some of these ‚Äúfirst-round‚Äù questions in later interviews to get diverse perspectives from the full panel.An example of a high-signal question that one of my coaching clients formulated for an interview at Cruise, a self-driving car company: In your three years at Cruise, the privacy world has expanded, with the CCPA and other states discussing more regulations for consumer privacy‚Äîhow has this impacted the nature of your work, and what do you see as the biggest challenge or area of focus as Cruise continues to expand to new geos?Tony the Tiger is an unofficial and unpaid supporter of MVIP and formulating GR-R-REAT questions for interviewers.üéâ Voil√†! You‚Äôre ready for your next interview.Here‚Äôs a recap checklist you can use for your next first-round interview prep:Some timing guidelines:Cleaning up your resume, LinkedIn, and online presence: 1-2 hours*Crafting a strategic, compelling career story: 1-1.5 hoursMining the job description: 30 minutesWalking down memory lane: 1-2 hours the first time; 30 minutes to refresh for any additional interviewsMastering behavioral questions: 4-6 hours*Formulating high-signal questions for interviewers: 1-2 hours* A one-time task for your entire job search, not for every single interviewIf you use MVIP, you can prepare for a first-round interview in three or four days (with about four hours per day of prep). If you‚Äôre working full-time, you can do it in a week with two to three hours a day. Much of what you learn with this MVIP interview prep system is reusable across interviews, so you will quickly see the effect of your preparation in later interviews.Now you know how to prepare for and pass any first-round interview, even in a tough talent market. I‚Äôd love to hear your success stories using MVIP.

How Ramp builds product - by Lenny Rachitsky

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeI was talking to a prominent VC the other day about what startups he‚Äôs watching, and he told me that he‚Äôs seeing one company quickly becoming a gravity for the best talent: Ramp. If you‚Äôre not familiar with Ramp, they provide corporate cards and a spend management platform, helping startups save money and control spending. They were last valued at over $8 billion, are backed by Founders Fund, Redpoint, Stripe, and others, and in the past year grew 4x, to over $10 billion in annualized spending. I believe they are also the fastest-growing SaaS company of all time, hitting a $100 million run rate in two years. I‚Äôm not an investor, but I wish I were.In part five of an ongoing series on how the best product teams build product (don‚Äôt miss Figma, Coda, Duolingo, and Miro‚Äîand Notion, Linear, and Snowflake coming soon), I sat down with Geoff Charles, Ramp‚Äôs VP of Product, to understand what Ramp has done right (and wrong) over the years in how they approach product. This is definitely my new favorite edition of this series, and you‚Äôll soon see why below.Here‚Äôs what stood out to me most about Ramp‚Äôs approach to product:Velocity, velocity, velocity.Their unique product strategy framework, including this template.Anchoring their product strategy to their financial model.Their evolution from two-week sprints to bi-yearly planning with detailed quarterly roadmaps.Focus on efficiency‚Äîthey had fewer than five PMs and 50 engineers when they hit $100 million in ARR.Teams are organized around business outcomes (e.g. increase attach rate for bill payments).Product, design, and engineering all report to the CTO.Emphasis on thinking from first principles.Their approach to hiring, e.g. hiring ICs vs. managersFor more from Geoff, follow him on LinkedIn and Twitter.How Ramp builds productGeoff Charles1. How far out do you plan in detail, and how has that evolved over the years?At Ramp, our culture is velocity. It shapes every process and team ritual. It‚Äôs how we develop our people. It‚Äôs our solution to nearly every problem. And most importantly, velocity is key to our business strategy. It‚Äôs how we deliver on our mission to save customers their most valuable resources‚Äîtheir team‚Äôs time and money.Our entire planning process is optimized toward product velocity. In essence, we believe that doing is better than planning. Any second you spend planning is a second you don‚Äôt spend doing. The moment you are aligned in a direction, you don‚Äôt need a high level of accuracy. It‚Äôs impossible and costly to try to predict what you can do‚Äîand part of our competitive advantage has been that we can respond very quickly to the change in environment, strategy, or customer feedback. We learn something new every day that helps us adjust our plan. While the balance between planning and execution has evolved over Ramp‚Äôs growth, we‚Äôre still very much in execution mode even today:Pre-product-market fit, sub-20 people: When I first joined Ramp, our main focus was to find product-market fit. We had a million ideas, but what truly mattered was how we were able to execute. This required being laser-focused on delivering one thing at a time, fast. We planned in two-week sprints because you could easily forecast two weeks ahead. It was all about doing as much as possible, as quickly as possible. The ‚Äúbacklog‚Äù didn‚Äôt exist. It was all about, what are we doing today? This week? We weren‚Äôt planning beyond that.Product-market fit with the core card product, 100+ people: We started planning in months for one to two quarters at a time. We needed deeper coordination with sales, marketing, and customer operations teams‚Äîteams that operate on cadences longer than two weeks (you can‚Äôt change sales quotas in two-week cycles). We also shifted our technology teams toward thinking about the reusability and durability of systems‚Äîand this requires you to know what capabilities you would want to build in the future.Multiple products in a portfolio, 500+ people: At this current stage, we know we have a sustainable core business that we‚Äôre taking upmarket, multiple emerging products, and rapidly growing go-to-market teams to help us tackle expansion in both our customer mix and product/market targets. The upmarket has longer sales cycles, and launching ambitious, coherent GTM campaigns needs much more lead time. Now we plan on a quarterly basis, and reserve the right to toss out the plan the moment it is written.2. Do you use OKRs in some form?Oftentimes people start and get very bogged down with OKRs when where they should really start is strategy. The process of OKRs to me feels forced‚Äîyou know what you want to do, and you have to reverse engineer an objective and a metric to fit into this framework. You sweat the wording and the specific metric. Teams feel like they are being judged on the metric. There is so much iteration. And at the end of all this, not much has changed from the original plan.¬†To win in the market, you need to be product-strategy-driven, not sales- or marketing-driven. You need to believe that the product strategy will deliver value to the customer, and that in turn drives value to the business. That belief is earned and needs to start early in the company‚Äôs lifecycle.Here‚Äôs the way we plan:Start with product strategy, bottom-up. Define clearly what you want to achieve and why achieving this will lead to outsize outcomes for the customer and the company. The process of developing pod-level product roadmaps is almost entirely bottom-up. Once we align on our product vision and the top two or three goals we have as a company, we empower the folks closest to the problem to develop their own product roadmaps. Then we co-develop the top-level product strategy. The way we write out a product strategy is as follows:¬†Goal ‚Üí What do you want to see in the world?Hypothesis ‚Üí Why do you think this will work?Right to Win ‚Üí Why are we uniquely positioned to do this?Metric ‚Üí How will you measure that it does?Initiatives ‚Üí What do we need to do to reach the goal?Risks ‚Üí Why would we fail & what should we do about it?Long Term Outcomes ‚Üí How will this work compound?Here‚Äôs a template of our planning doc.Anchor the product strategy with the financial model. A product strategy that is not anchored on the reality of how the company needs to make money will not survive. We need to constantly understand how we will monetize, and the tradeoffs between innovation, monetization, and growth. For example, for one quarter we might be focused on increasing our operating margins, or decreasing our credit losses, or launching a new revenue stream‚Äîwe align on this with finance.¬†Publish the product roadmap and align it with the marketing calendar. We share a high-level roadmap, get feedback from leaders across the company, and ensure that it is in lockstep with large marketing moments we co-develop. This helps us amplify our product releases and get loud in the market. Planning is not just specifying goals but also trade-offs. Everyone wants everything to be done‚Äîbut that simply can‚Äôt happen. By making explicit what trade-offs you are making, we were able to engage in much more nuanced discussions around whether we should do X vs. Y instead of the absolute. For example:Define company-level OKRs to mobilize cross-functional teams. Timebox company OKR planning, and stay high-level. We realized that we were planning one month every quarter‚Äîthat‚Äôs 33% of the time. We ended up switching to bi-annually (planning twice a year) and scoped it to be the top priorities for the entire company rather than a laundry list of what every team was doing. The point of the exercise is to make trade-offs‚Äîit should be painful. Not everything on the roadmap needs to be in the company-level OKRs. We limit them to a few large cross-functional projects or launches.¬†Here‚Äôs a planning template filled out:OKRs should not be used for performance management. Each team is assessed differently. For example, sales are based on quota attainment and ‚Äúclosed won‚Äù conversion. Support is based on ‚Äúsolves per hour‚Äù and ‚Äúcustomer satisfaction.‚Äù None of these should be in OKRs. While everything is measured at Ramp through scorecards, we focus OKRs on things we want to improve vs. just maintain. To reach these goals requires deep collaboration between, say, engineering, product, marketing, and sales. If we don‚Äôt hit the goal, that does not necessarily mean everyone tied to the goal underperformed. You need to go to a level much deeper than that to assess performance.¬†3. How do your product/design review meetings work?At Ramp, we build in the open and empower teams as much as possible to make the decisions in order to move quickly. What this means in practice is that every spec, design, decision, progress, and status is published in project-specific Slack channels, and anyone is invited to read and opine. Essentially, teams farm for dissent, not approval. Eliminating gatekeepers ensures that things keep moving forward.¬†When there were fewer than 100 people, I could actually read everything. I would get notified anytime something was published or a key decision was made, and would review it and share any important perspectives. Three things broke as we scaled:As teams got bigger, I could no longer be everywhere and have all the context. I needed teams to ‚Äúmanage up‚Äù‚Äîto synthesize context and key decisions for input.As PMs on the team got more senior, more trust had to be built. PMs deserved more autonomy to decide what they needed input on.Design teams were hearing one thing from the head of design in design jams and another from the head of product. If we weren‚Äôt aligned, it slowed things down.¬†So for key decisions and high-risk projects, we now trust the PMs to bring these up in the weekly product ‚Äújam session.‚Äù This is meant to accelerate context sharing, decisions, and alignment between product, design, and engineering. Here are some of our design principles:Focus on what truly matters, which is any new product or major change to the core user experience. PMs should ask themselves: If we get this wrong, what impact could it have on our product goals? If the answer is ‚Äúbig impact,‚Äù get input at the meeting. Otherwise, take the risk and skip the meeting.¬†Don‚Äôt slow down teams. We needed something lightweight, frequent, and non-blocking. The head of product and design blocked out an hour every week (Wednesdays at 4 p.m.). Folks simply sign up. We are always available.¬†Ensure alignment between product and design. By having both product and design leadership in the room, you ensure that they are aligned. This speeds things up instead of hearing feedback from two different people at different times.Stick with relevant folks. Include the engineering leaders involved. Exclude anyone outside of tech‚Äîtheir perspective should have been covered as part of the initial spec process as key stakeholders.Process is like a product‚Äîit requires constant iteration, and we‚Äôre still iterating.4. Are product and design part of the same org? And who do PMs ultimately report to? Has this changed over the years?The biggest lever to high velocity is designing your organization structure so that teams are forced to cooperate.¬†PM, Design, Engineering, and Data should be equal parts of the same team. This has largely stayed the same since the beginning. I tend to think that if design reports into Product, the UX suffers. Design needs to have some of their own agenda, their own discovery. This is where you come up with truly brilliant ideas.Everyone should report to the same tech-minded leader. There is no better way to force a relationship to happen than by having each head report into the same leader‚Äîin our case, we all report into the CTO. If Product reports into the CEO and Engineering into the CTO, then the only way to escalate differences is if the CTO and CEO talk to each other; that‚Äôs too high up the chain. You then run the risk of Product being ‚Äústakeholders‚Äù to Engineering instead of being ‚Äúco-founders‚Äù‚Äîand not being product-driven.Design your org the way you want your product to perform. Ultimately, you ship your org structure. Think about what the core competencies are that you want to amplify to accomplish your product strategy. If Data is not an equal, you are not elevating data-driven decision-making, data-science-driven products, and objective accountability. This matters as you get larger.5. Broadly, do you structure your teams around products, user types, user journey, outcomes, or something in between? Has this changed over the years?One of the biggest impacts to velocity is how you organize product teams. Here is how we did this at Ramp:Teams are organized based on customer or business outcomes above all else. The team needs to be accountable for something big. That lights a fire behind a team and makes them want to run through walls. Years ago, we gave a team the mandate to drive 50% of our sales qualified leads by automating outbound emails. And they did. We gave a team three months to build a competitor to Bill.com. And they did. Big goals, tight timelines, and fully autonomous resourcing (remove as many dependencies as possible) were the common ingredients. The key here is for tech teams to deeply understand how the business functions.Teams publish openly clear contracts with each other. In order to exist, each team needs to publish, visibly and clearly, their contract and reason for existence to the rest of the org:¬†A goal: what they want to achieveA strategy: how they will win (see template above)A roadmap: what they will buildMetrics: how they are measuredUser flows: the UXUnderlying systems: the techStakeholders: who they work with¬†Make staffing flexible, regardless of reporting lines. To maintain velocity, we have a very flexible model, where folks can jump to different teams based on the business needs and work with engineers who might report to different people. Management is about hiring, staffing, coaching, and development. We leverage Tech Leads in scrum teams who don‚Äôt manage but drive strategy and execution. By keeping reporting structures the same and re-organizing pods, we can respond quickly to new opportunities without needing to constantly destroy relationships between managers and their teams.¬†Embed platform teams as long as possible. Pure platform teams are often too far removed from the business context to make the right prioritization decisions and move with velocity. So we try to keep platform teams embedded in core product teams for as long as we can. Our payments platform was embedded within our Bill Pay product because most of the new use cases were B2B payments. Our data-science platform was embedded within our risk team since most of our data-science needs were on underwriting. We spin teams out after they‚Äôve had a few wins to force them to work across teams.Keep teams small so they move fast. We don‚Äôt like having more than 5 to 10 engineers on a given team. For example, we spun up a new team to build our Bill Pay product. That pod became four subpods as we grew, and we spun out one of those subpods fully to own workflows across Ramp.Map the rest of the org to your tech teams. What‚Äôs important in org design is having single-threaded teams that have the resources they need to execute on big opportunities. We ensured early on that the entire company, not just the tech organization, was mapped to product goals, which were ultimately mapped to business goals. For example, each product ‚Äúpod‚Äù has a dedicated Product Marketer, Product Operator, Product Partnerships Lead, and Product Counsel. They are responsible for quarterbacking the product strategy within their respective organizations.6. How many PMs are there at this point?We have 14 PMs at Ramp today (and we‚Äôre hiring!).¬†We try to increase leverage as much as possible‚Äîdefined by impact divided by headcount. We reward teams that were able to get more done with very little. For the first two years at Ramp, we had fewer than five PMs and fewer than 50 engineers as we scaled to $100 million in ARR. I try to restrict PM hiring until it‚Äôs patently obvious to everyone that product is the bottleneck to velocity. This does a few things:It makes everyone at the company do some type of PM job‚Äîwhich helps build a culture of caring about business goals, customer pain points, and shipping.¬†It makes every other PM have a larger scope‚Äîwhich eliminates the time-consuming fight for resources and politics. They simply have too much to do to ask for more.¬†It makes the team welcome that PM when they actually join, and gives them clear value to deliver to give them a win.7. What‚Äôs in your product-team tool stack?In order to empower teams to move quickly, we focused less on which tool to use and more on what the tool should accomplish:This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

How to build a killer sales pitch - by April Dunford

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeI suck at selling. I bet you do too. But that‚Äôs no excuse. We saw in last week‚Äôs post how important founder-led sales is in the early days of a startup, and as we‚Äôll see in next week‚Äôs post, it only gets more important as you grow. Thus, I‚Äôm always on the lookout for actionable advice on how to get better at sales. When I heard that April Dunford (frequent collaborator, and author of the amazing bestseller Obviously Awesome) was working on a new book about sales, I knew it would be outstanding (it is). I convinced her to write a guest post sharing some of her best advice from the book. Per usual, she overdelivered. I suspect this post will transform how you pitch your product. Inside:Why buying software is surprisingly harder than selling itWhy your real competition isn‚Äôt competitors, it‚Äôs the buyer‚Äôs ‚Äúno decision‚ÄùHow and why you‚Äôre getting your sales pitch wrongA two-part sales pitch structure that‚Äôll transform your sales processA bunch of examples and frameworks you can apply todayFor more from April, do not miss her new book, Sales Pitch: How to Craft a Story to Stand Out and Win‚Äîit just came out this week! April also has a new podcast, where she shares bite-size lessons on positioning, marketing, sales, and standing out from the competition, and you can follow her on LinkedIn and X.In Matthew Dixon and Ted McKenna‚Äôs new book, The JOLT Effect, they analyzed over 2 million sales calls looking for patterns that could teach us what works and doesn‚Äôt work in successful sales processes. One of their key findings was that 40% to 60% of B2B purchase processes result in ‚Äúno decision.‚Äù And in the majority of the cases, the company didn‚Äôt decide to stick with the status quo because they decided it was better than other options. They failed to buy because they couldn‚Äôt figure out how to confidently make a decision. In B2B software, it turns out buyers are more worried about messing up than they are about missing out. Let‚Äôs understand why, and what we can do about it to significantly improve your sales success.Selling is hard, but buying is harderRather than focus on sales from our perspective as vendors, I‚Äôd like you to imagine what it‚Äôs like for a buyer. I think today, buying is harder‚Äîparticularly if we are talking about B2B software.¬†I‚Äôve had folks laugh at me when I say that. They say things like, ‚ÄúApril, that‚Äôs called shopping, and that‚Äôs not hard. I wish it was my job to buy stuff all day!‚Äù I get it‚Äîsome things are fun to buy. I like shopping for shoes or T-shirts. But there are many things that are definitely not fun to buy. Have you ever bought insurance? How about a house? These are stressful purchases! Most of the things we love shopping for are low-stakes decisions, where there isn‚Äôt much of a problem if we make a poor choice. If I buy the wrong pack of mints at the convenience store, it‚Äôs not a big deal; I just won‚Äôt buy that one again. Insurance, on the other hand, is different. There are complex options to consider and, often, other people involved who could be impacted by the decision. If I make a poor choice, really bad things could happen.¬†Many of the decisions that B2B technology buyers make are difficult because the stakes are high. A bad decision could lead to bad things for both the company and the buyer personally. Let‚Äôs look at a typical purchase process for an enterprise B2B product.¬†A typical B2B purchase processJanet, the VP of Finance, has been struggling through an audit. She decides the company has outgrown its accounting software and they need to look at new options. Does she go looking for new accounting software to buy? Nope, she‚Äôs got an audit to deal with. She calls her controller, Joey, and says, ‚ÄúI need you to find us a new accounting software. Come back to me with a recommendation, and I will sign off on it.‚ÄùHow‚Äôs Joey feeling at this moment? He‚Äôs pissed! And a bit stressed. He doesn‚Äôt know much about accounting software. Sure, he uses the current platform, but he doesn‚Äôt know which the best accounting software vendors are or what the state of the art of accounting software is. He‚Äôs never purchased accounting software before in his life.Joey turns to the internet for help. He researches accounting software and finds hundreds of products, each with similar-sounding features and each claiming to be ‚ÄúThe world‚Äôs best accounting software.‚Äù Comparison sites like G2 list a dozen ‚Äúleading‚Äù software packages. There are hundreds of features to consider‚Äîsome he understands, many he doesn‚Äôt. He signs up for a handful of trials, but he‚Äôs got questions that a trial can‚Äôt answer. How will this work during an audit? Will it integrate into our current IT stack and meet our security requirements? What about support for international offices?¬†He books a demo with a shortlist of vendors, looking for answers. In each call, the sales rep asks Joey a bunch of questions about his requirements, his biggest challenges, and what he‚Äôs looking for. Joey answers as best he can, but he‚Äôs worried he doesn‚Äôt really know the answers. Are there other requirements he should be thinking about? The rep does a detailed product walkthrough demo, showing Joey dozens of product features. Joey‚Äôs not sure how important any of these are for his business and whether or not every new accounting package has them.At this point, Joey‚Äôs stress is peaking. What if he recommends a product to his boss and she hates it? What if the accounting team hates it and blames him for picking it? What if the product doesn‚Äôt have the audit capabilities needed and the company fails the audit? Joey could get passed up for a promotion. Heck, he might get fired.¬†What is the easiest decision for Joey to make at this moment? The easiest thing for him to do is to go back to his boss and say, ‚ÄúHey, now‚Äôs not a good time to switch accounting platforms; we have an audit to worry about, after all. What we have now isn‚Äôt perfect, but it‚Äôs fine. Let‚Äôs delay the decision until next year.‚Äù Delaying the decision gets Joey off the hook, and next year maybe he won‚Äôt be picked to figure out what package to buy.¬†The origins of a better pitch structureMany of the B2B companies I work with use a pitch structure that is essentially a feature walkthrough. The sales rep logs in to the product and methodically takes the customer through as many features as they can cover in the time they have. There is little talk about which features are unique to the product and which are common to every solution on the market. It is left to the customer to determine why the features matter. There is rarely any talk about other potential approaches to the problem. In short, many sales pitches don‚Äôt do a great job of helping a prospect decide why they should choose your product over the alternatives.In the early days of my product marketing career, similar to Joey‚Äôs experience, I built pitches that were essentially detailed product walkthroughs. Sometimes we would throw in a company background slide, a case study, and sometimes a customer logo slide. If we were being really fancy, we would start with a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù slide before we moved to the product walkthrough (and in general, that problem was so vague, any of our competitors could also say they solved it).¬†My perspective changed when I landed at IBM and had to build a sales pitch deck using their pitch structure.At IBM, our pitch structure was very specifically designed for IBM deals (which were gigantic, highly technical, and took an eternity to close), and some of the components were heavily influenced by The Challenger Sale. Not everything in the structure made sense for other companies, but there were two key things I thought could work anywhere. First, the pitch always started with IBM‚Äôs unique insight into the market, and, secondly, we never talked about features outside of the context of the value those features delivered for customers. The pitch was never about ‚Äúpushing‚Äù our products on buyers. It was always about helping customers make confident purchase decisions.¬†When I left IBM to join another startup, I stole these ideas and built a ‚Äústartup-ified‚Äù pitch structure I could use to map positioning to a sales pitch. The new pitch dramatically improved revenue (and, ironically, led to us being acquired by IBM).I have now successfully used an evolving version of this pitch structure with over 200 B2B technology companies ranging in size from seed-stage startups to big companies like Google and Epic Games. I think it could help any company thinking about improving the way they communicate in sales meetings. Let‚Äôs dive in.¬†A better sales pitch structureThe pitch structure is composed of two main parts: the setup and the follow-through. The setup is where we give customers a way to think about the entire market and get them aligned with our point of view. The follow-through is focused on our differentiated value and how we deliver that.At a very high level, the structure looks like this:The ‚Äúmarket insight‚Äù stage gives customers a way to think about the entire market so they can understand the trade-offs associated with different approaches and confidently make better decisions. Differentiated value (the value we can deliver to a customer‚Äôs business that nobody else can) is the core of our positioning, so it makes sense that it should form the core of our sales pitch.¬†Let‚Äôs look at an example where we contrast a typical feature walkthrough with a more positioning-oriented pitch.¬†Help Scout exampleBackgroundHelp Scout provides a customer service solution for modern digital businesses. Their point of view is that customer service is a growth driver, not a cost center. Traditional help-desk software treats service as a cost center and focuses on reducing time spent with agents. Help Scout was built for online businesses that do not have physical stores or salespeople, so support is one of the few places where customers interact directly with the company. For these businesses, delivering a great experience can strengthen customer loyalty, driving repeat purchases and revenue growth.Looking at the competitive landscape, many of Help Scout‚Äôs customers started by simply using a shared email inbox for support. As their business grows, these customers need a solution with more advanced features, like prioritization and assignments, leading them to look at traditional help-desk vendors.¬†Let‚Äôs contrast a typical product walkthrough pitch with a pitch that mirrors Help Scout‚Äôs differentiated value.¬†Feature walkthrough pitch for Help ScoutA feature walkthrough would flow like this:Log inShow the shared inboxShow some advanced features‚Äîassignments, prioritization, etc.Show how customers can choose any interaction channelShow how customers are not assigned ‚Äúticket‚Äù numbersEtc., etc., until we run out of featuresThe problem with this is that it appears there is a lot of overlap in the features that a shared inbox has and the features that a traditional help-desk solution has. Why pick Help Scout over the alternatives? It‚Äôs not entirely clear.A better sales pitch for Help ScoutUsing the improved sales pitch structure, the flow would look more like this:We know from working with e-commerce businesses like yours that customer service can drive brand loyalty and growth.¬†You have choices in the approach you take to customer service. Here‚Äôs what we have seen with our customers:Use a shared inbox: Service users love it because it‚Äôs easy to get started. The downside is, as you grow, you will want more advanced service features, like assignments and prioritization, and you will have to move to something else.¬†Use a traditional help-desk tool: This gives you all the features a growing customer service group needs; unfortunately, it‚Äôs a lot harder for the team to use. The bigger issue here is that these tools were designed to reduce costs‚Äîby driving customers to lower-cost channels and minimizing their time with agents‚Äînot to give customers an amazing experience.¬†We think what e-comm businesses really need is an easy-to-use tool that has advanced features so they never outgrow it, but was designed from the ground up to provide an amazing customer experience. Would you agree with that?Let me show you how we do that (this is the follow-through and can be a demo):Show how easy it is to useShow the advanced features, emphasizing that you won‚Äôt outgrow itShow the features oriented around giving a great customer experience‚Äîa customer chooses the channel, is not assigned a ‚Äúticket‚Äù number, etc.Show case study examples that demonstrate the improvement in customer loyalty and revenue¬†This version of the pitch is entirely oriented around answering the question ‚ÄúWhy pick us versus the other approaches?‚ÄùDone well, the setup should take only a few minutes, but it is a crucial few minutes that helps to set the context for why our differentiated value matters to them.¬†The setup phase should be a conversation with the prospect. At each step we are asking: Does this resonate with you? What are you folks using today? Have you considered other options? In sales, we call this discovery, and it is a critical point where the sales rep is getting a deeper understanding of the prospect‚Äôs situation and understanding of the market.¬†A more detailed look at the setupLet‚Äôs break the setup down into the smaller components and then walk through another example:The setup comprises three components: insight, alternatives, and ‚Äúthe perfect world.‚Äù1. The insightThis is the most crucial step and also the hardest. Our insight underpins our point of view on the market. I like to think of it this way‚Äîwhat does a customer need to know in order to understand why our differentiated value is important? For Help Scout, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúCustomer service is a growth driver, not a cost center.‚ÄùThis post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

Simplify security.‚ÄîRichard Rumelt is a legend in the world of strategy. He‚Äôs the author of Good Strategy/Bad Strategy and The Crux: How Leaders Become Strategists, both of which are often recommended by guests on this podcast. From his early days teaching in Iran at a Harvard-sponsored business school to teaching at Harvard Business School itself to over four decades teaching at UCLA‚Äôs Anderson School of Management, Richard‚Äôs impact resonates globally. His strategic insights are sought after by major corporations including Microsoft, Shell, Apple, AT&T, Intel, and Commonwealth Bank and by governmental organizations such as the U.S. Army Special Operations Command. In this episode, we discuss:‚Ä¢ The essential components of a good strategy‚Ä¢ The importance of coherence in strategy‚Ä¢ Common pitfalls that create a bad strategy‚Ä¢ How ‚Äúpower‚Äù plays into strategy, and common sources of power‚Ä¢ The value of knowing history when developing effective strategies‚Ä¢ Why a strategy should simply be called an ‚Äúaction agenda‚Äù‚Ä¢ The need for one decider in an organizationSome takeaways:Goals, ambitions, visions, missions, values‚Äînone of these things are a strategy. Strategies are fundamentally about what you‚Äôll do in response to a challenge. Richard says you should replace the term strategy altogether and just call it an ‚Äúaction agenda.‚ÄùThe ‚Äúkernel‚Äù of any strategy comprises three parts: diagnosis, a clear definition of the challenge at hand; guiding policies, your overall approach to dealing with the challenge; and coherent actions, the set of specific steps you‚Äôll take to implement the guiding policies and overcome the challenge.The most common cause of bad strategy is a weak diagnosis. The second most common is confusing goals with strategy.When forming strategy from scratch, look for the ‚Äúcrux‚Äù of your problem. The crux on a rock climb is the hardest part of the climb. If you can‚Äôt get past it, you shouldn‚Äôt do that climb in the first place.

How Notion builds product - by Lenny Rachitsky

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeLast week I was working in my home office, and I heard my wife in the other room yell, ‚ÄúI love Notion!‚Äù I know what she means. With over 20 million people and hundreds of thousands of teams using Notion around the world to organize their work and get things done, she‚Äôs not alone. Notion is currently the fourth fastest-growing app in the world (it was #1 last year) and, unsurprisingly, has also been the most requested team for me to chronicle in my ongoing series on how the best product teams build product.I‚Äôm excited to finally deliver, and it‚Äôs been worth the wait. A huge thank-you to Michael Manapat, Notion‚Äôs Chief Product and Technology Officer, and the whole Notion team, for answering my many questions. Per usual, you‚Äôll find tons of actionable lessons and frameworks, and more than any other edition, it‚Äôs jam-packed with plug-and-play templates.Here‚Äôs what stood out to me most about Notion‚Äôs approach to product:The amount of iteration they‚Äôre going through as they scale through hypergrowthHow few PMs (and designers) they have (similar to Ramp!)‚Äîand how long they waited to hire their first product managerTheir four-point product review processHow interconnected all of the products are, and how that impacts their org designTheir twice-yearly planning cycles, two-week sprints, and quarter-plus planning cadence (similar to Coda!)Their shift from primarily async product feedback to more of an emphasis on real-time conversationsThe fact that data, design, research, eng, PM, UXR, and security all report up to Michael‚Äîand why that‚Äôs the caseAlso, as you‚Äôll see below, Notion is launching Notion Projects tomorrow, May 31. Notion Projects combines project management with your docs, knowledge base, and AI in one connected workspace. Learn more about it here.For more from Michael, follow him on LinkedIn and Twitter. And for more stories of how the best product teams operate, don‚Äôt miss my other deep dives into Figma, Coda, Duolingo, Miro, and Ramp.How Notion builds productMichael Manapat, Chief Product and Technology Officer1. How far out do you plan in detail, and how has that evolved over the years?I make the joke that we change how we plan every planning cycle and that we need to plan for planning. Historically, we didn‚Äôt really look beyond what we wanted to do in a given half. And that‚Äôs actually something we have recognized is a bit of a problem, in that we‚Äôre always solving for what we can do in a few months and not thinking as holistically as we could be about the long term. We‚Äôre figuring out how we can both maintain the coordination rigor and discipline that regular planning provides while also making sure we have the room to think more broadly about the future.All that said, we roughly plan for each half, with differing resolutions for the two quarters. As an example, at the beginning of this year, we said for Q1, list out all of your projects in detail with a prioritization of the roadmap, and for Q2, just give some high-level bullet points of what you think you‚Äôll be working on. We then did planning for Q2 as the quarter started, taking those bullet points and making them concrete, with some added guidance for things that changed in the company strategy between Q1 and Q2.Duplicate Notion‚Äôs annual planning exercise template ‚ÜíIn terms of how teams operate within each quarter, one thing philosophically is that I don‚Äôt like mandating organization-wide process approaches‚Äîat least in terms of how teams run themselves. (We do have org-wide processes for product review; see below.) We generally leave it to individual groups or teams to figure out what type of cadence makes sense for them. These days, however, it is the case that all product teams operate on two-week sprint cycles, and those cycles are all aligned across the organization. This last sprint just started yesterday, actually, across the whole company.What individual teams do for sprints varies a lot. Some are quite disciplined and precise‚Äîthey actually write down all of the commitments they think will get done, and at the end of the sprint they will assess what exactly got done that sprint. For the teams that are, say, doing longer-term work on infrastructure, sprints are more just a unit of time and not an accountability mechanism. So the only thing that‚Äôs really shared is this two-week cycle, but there‚Äôs a lot of variation in what people do within their team.Notion‚Äôs new sprints feature, available May 31I‚Äôm always wondering‚Äîwe‚Äôre not that large a company, at 550 people‚Äîcan we just be a bit more dynamic? We know what the strategy is and what our goals overall are, so can we do something a bit more continuous? The whole ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to stop the whole world to figure out what to do for the next half‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs really important, especially for coordination with our go-to-market teams and other cross-functional ones, but within the product org it‚Äôs not clear to me that it suits our needs particularly well. But I also don‚Äôt have a better approach yet.2. How many PMs do you have?Under 15. Out of 550 people. Our product management team is tiny. As you probably know, we waited a long time to hire product managers. We didn‚Äôt have PMs until two years ago, at around 50 or 60 engineers. I‚Äôm not sure this was actually ideal. Both Notion and my former employer Stripe are both very engineering-driven to start, and both companies have a very product-minded engineering core, which I think is a great thing. That said, there is a difference between engineers who think about product, and product managers who are out there talking to users and bringing in user feedback constantly, coordinating closely with go-to-market teams, and thinking deeply about product strategy. And I think that was missing at Notion early on. So I‚Äôm glad we have PMs now and that we‚Äôre growing the product management team.One thing that‚Äôs interesting about Notion is that no part of the product can really be isolated. At Stripe, there were a number of essentially completely independent product lines. In the group that I managed, the products were only linked by the competencies needed to build them (beyond general product work, there was a need for machine learning and AI depth). For example, there was Radar, the fraud product. And there was Capital, a lending product. And they were linked by being ML- and AI-powered products, but they were otherwise independent‚Äîvery little that Radar did would affect Capital and vice versa. You can‚Äôt decompose Notion into individual products. So if you‚Äôre working on the Project Management offering at Notion and you change how databases work, or you change how pages work, that has implications for the use of Notion as a docs tool or a wiki tool. So there is a bit more of this central planning and product coordination problem here to make sure that things are considered holistically and that people aren‚Äôt stepping over each other in a way that makes the product worse.3. Do you use OKRs in some form?Yes, we use OKRs at the company level as part of planning. The output of each of these twice-yearly planning cycles is a set of company objectives and a set of key results.Duplicate Notion‚Äôs company objectives template ‚ÜíThere‚Äôs more variation below the company-level OKRs. Some teams or groups do have OKRs; for example, teams working on product-led growth. In other areas, things are sufficiently nascent that a lot of our key results end up being like ‚Äúship this thing,‚Äù and it has frankly been a journey for us to figure out when so much of what we‚Äôre trying to do is zero-to-one work, and how we actually measure success. What does that look like? What is the right framework for it? I would say we‚Äôre certainly far from Google, where they have OKRs at the company, the group, the team, and the individual level.4. How do your product/design review meetings work?This is another area where we‚Äôve been iterating a lot. We used to have something that we called ‚Äúworking sessions.‚Äù They would be between 30 and 45 minutes and relatively unstructured. When the team wanted to discuss something with product leadership or we had something we wanted to discuss with the team, we‚Äôd actually just ask to meet and the prompt would be something high-level. And these ended up being basically brainstorming or ideation sessions.What we found was we needed a bit more structure to make sure things were moving along. We also wanted to make sure that feedback from [Notion co-founders Simon Last and Ivan Zhao] and me was coming at known moments, and not just, for example, two days before launch, seemingly out of nowhere.So what‚Äôs happening now is that we have a process where at four points in the product development process, we have a ‚Äúcheck-in.‚Äù The four points are:The statement of the user problemA discussion of possible directions‚Äîwhat are the three or so high-level possible approaches to solve the user problem, and what does the team recommend?The full solution, with high-fidelity designs and everything scoped outThe ship candidate, ready for a final quality checkAll of these are predominantly asynchronous. At each of these steps, an engineer, designer, PM, or EM will send an email describing where they are, and then we‚Äôll review and give feedback asynchronously. We‚Äôll talk about everything from ‚ÄúWhat exactly is the user problem?‚Äù to ‚ÄúHow does this thing interact with this other thing?‚Äù to sometimes nitpicky details of the product.We‚Äôve discovered, though, that async check-ins don‚Äôt work for some types of discussions. What are all the options you explored, and how do you think about each of them? Why did you choose them? Putting that in a doc and explaining that in writing takes a lot of time. People were spending way too much time documenting this stuff, and then when you take into account the email exchanges and then the responses and all of that, the process would drag out for quite a while.So we‚Äôre tweaking our approach right now. For the exploration-of-the-directions step, we‚Äôre going to start focusing on in-person discussions with the team. Come in and let‚Äôs stare at Figma together, discuss the pros and cons of each variant, ask questions, and align on reasoning. We normally schedule those types of synchronous check-ins for half an hour. Sometimes they‚Äôre faster and sometimes they take longer (we had one yesterday, and it went a little bit over, to 40 minutes).We only began doing this four-stage check-in process in February. To start, we asked for essentially all product work to go through that. By ‚Äúall,‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean every single change, of course. But any project with meaningful product impact goes through this. And it has been helpful for me, as I‚Äôve ramped up relatively recently on working with our product team, to get a sense of everything that‚Äôs going on. But as part of our next iteration, we‚Äôre also going to introduce tiering so only P0 projects get reviewed by me.5. Are product and design part of the same org? And who do PMs ultimately report to? Has this changed over the years?We have a unified product and technology organization‚Äîengineering, product management, design, data, user research, and security all roll up to me. Our data lead, design lead, research lead, engineering and product management group leads, user research lead, plus the person working on our overall technical approach and our CISO‚Äîthey‚Äôre all peers and my directs, and we frequently meet and plan together.I personally really like this, because you get a lot of crosstalk and exposure to what‚Äôs going on with all of those people in the same room. If you go back a year, Janna, who leads user research here [and who Lenny worked with at Airbnb for many years!], and Daniel, who leads Data, weren‚Äôt frequently in the same forums even though both of their functions involve our learning about our users, their needs, how they behave, etc.But now everyone has visibility into what the organization overall is working on, and Fatemeh, who manages our Core Product engineering group here [who Lenny also worked with at Airbnb!]), can hear our Enterprise PM lead Birkan talking about plans to work with users at a particular scale and figure out what‚Äôs needed on her end. I think more gets surfaced proactively when you have a mixed leadership group like this.6. How do you structure your product teams?Right now there are essentially four layers of teams. There are teams working on user-facing use cases or stories or workflows‚Äîfor example, the project management team, or the docs and wiki team. And they own making sure that the user problems around that use case are solved well by Notion through a combination of leveraging existing primitives in the product, extending them as needed, and developing custom functionality. And then below that, figuratively speaking, there are teams that own what you might call underlying primitives, things like databases in Notion. Databases actually power both the wiki and also project management, so the team that is thinking about wikis and the team that is thinking about project management are both ‚Äúclients‚Äù of this databases team (which we call ‚ÄúCollections‚Äù internally).And then below that there are Notion-wide systems, like search, notifications, the sidebar, and so forth, with a PM lead‚ÄîEkin‚Äîwho oversees all of these. And then below that is Infrastructure. That‚Äôs sort of how our grouping is right now. (To be clear, these layers are metaphorical and don‚Äôt correspond exactly to org structure.)Sometimes things don‚Äôt always map cleanly onto any of these single teams. We have a product team that is thinking about the enterprise segment overall, though their day-to-day work is generally focused on what a particular persona (the enterprise buyer or admin) needs. But with that overall segment focus, they need to think about things like‚Äîokay, what do companies with 20,000 users need from a wiki product? Well, they need something like verification of pages. And then they‚Äôll go and advocate for that even if another team builds it (which is what happened here). And also, what do they need from a data residency standpoint and data locality or security? That PM lead is also talking to Infrastructure. Large companies also need Notion to work well with other tools, which necessitates work on our API and integrations‚Äîpart of the middle layers. So Birkan, that PM lead, is really just working all over Notion and doesn‚Äôt map cleanly to a single team.7. What‚Äôs in your product-team tool stack?We use Notion for almost everything‚Äîwriting, project management, presentations, etc. And we hope at least for product teams that it really can be (almost) everything for them. The ‚Äúalmost‚Äù here is a reference to the fact that some important things you do in product‚Äîfor example, design (we use Figma), experiment setup and analysis (we use Statsig), or data analysis (we use Hex) you can‚Äôt do in Notion, and these aren‚Äôt use cases that would make sense in Notion‚Äîat least for a while. You can embed your work from many of these tools in Notion, of course, which helps keep Notion the ‚Äúhub‚Äù for all our work.How Notion keeps everything centralized using Google Drive and Figma previewsUnsurprisingly, project management is a big deal for us, both in terms of how we run projects internally and how Notion can enable users to run projects as part of a connected workspace with their other knowledge (their docs, wikis, meetings, etc.). Traditionally you needed to do a fair amount of setup to get the sort of project management framework (with projects, tasks, subtasks, etc.) in Notion that you might in another, project management-specific tool. It was possible given the generality of Notion‚Äôs primitives but not always easy. We have a big launch this week that we‚Äôre very excited about‚Äîit‚Äôll be much easier to use Notion for project management, whether for general use or for issue-tracking for engineering and product teams, and there‚Äôll be direct support for things like sprints. Starting on the 31st, you‚Äôll be able to add our new project management tools to any teamspace.Duplicate Notion‚Äôs projects template ‚ÜíNotion AI is also getting extended so that it‚Äôll automatically infer and complete information for you‚Äîby keeping project properties updated as other information changes automatically. We think this will be a big advance for how people use Notion for project management.8. You built one of the most beloved and successful products out there. What would you say is unique or central to your approach to product that leads to such a great and successful product?This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, here‚Äôs what you missed this month:What to do if your product isn‚Äôt taking offFirst-principles thinkingInspiration for the year aheadSubscribe to get access to these posts, and every post.SubscribeEvery business can be distilled into a simple equation.And until you can express your business as one, you don‚Äôt fully understand it.¬†Figuring out this equation forces you to think about the inputs that drive your business, the outputs you want to prioritize, and how these variables interact. It also gives you a map for understanding which metrics you need to track, what factors drive the growth of your business, and, most importantly, where you have the most leverage to drive an outsize amount of impact (and thus where to assign your precious people and resources).To help you flesh out your own business equation, Dan Hockenmaier and I put together example equations for the most common tech business models:B2B SaaSBottom-up B2B SaaS with seat-based pricingBottom-up B2B SaaS with usage-based pricingTop-down B2B SaaSB2C/consumerB2C subscription (trial or freemium)B2C free (ads)MarketplacesB2C marketplacesB2B marketplacesDTC/e-commerceFirst, a few disclaimers:This won‚Äôt be easy. These equations and concepts can be some of the most divisive within your company, particularly between your product, GTM, finance, and sales teams. But once the equations are defined, your teams are aligned, and the equations operationalized, you‚Äôll experience a huge force multiplier‚Äîbecause everyone will be focusing their energy on the same (high-leverage) levers.This won‚Äôt be perfect. While we lay out the different ‚Äúrecipes,‚Äù every business is unique. Thus, the equations will require some adapting to match your business. Please send us feedback (or leave a comment below) on anything you think we‚Äôre missing, or anything unique about your business that caused you to modify the equation you use. We‚Äôd love to hear it.We focused on ARR and revenue. All of these equations output revenue or ARR. If your business has high gross margins (e.g. >80%-90%), like some SaaS businesses, you may be able to stop there. But for any business with meaningful cost of sales, such as DTC and most marketplaces, you‚Äôll want to instead output a metric like contribution margin. For these cases, see the section at the end of the post on adding margin to your equation.Business equations don‚Äôt cover every important metric. One key metric for every business is customer acquisition payback period. This is related to but not directly captured in the equations below. See the section at the end on how to calculate your payback period.How to make the most of this postCreate your own business‚Äôs math formula, with inspiration from a formula belowHave a discussion with your team about how your business grows through the lens of this formulaIdentify the highest-leverage lever(s) within your formula, and put more resources behind itIdentify one new lever you haven‚Äôt invested in, and experiment with itTurn the formula into a full-fledged growth model (something we‚Äôll explore in a future post)A huge thank-you to Abi Noda (DX), Alex Bilmes (Endgame), Alexa Grabell (Pocus), Barry McCardel (Hex), Boris Jabes (Census), Christina Cacioppo (Vanta), Colin Dunn (Visual Electric), Dom Wong (Pogo), Emily Kramer (MKT1), Jeremy Cai (Italic), May Habib and James Lee (Writer), Merci Victoria Grace (Panobi), Nels Gilbreth, Peter Kazanjy (Atrium), Reed McGinley-Stempel (Stytch), Rujul Zaparde (Zip), Whitney Steele (Descript), William Hicks (Magic Mind), and Zach Grannis for sharing feedback and advice on this post üôè Also, don‚Äôt miss Dan Hockenmaier‚Äôs newsletter, which is a must-read for anyone working on growth and marketplaces.B2B SaaS equationsA B2B SaaS business sells cloud-hosted software on a subscription basis (that‚Äôs what makes it software as a service‚ÄîSaaS) to other businesses (that‚Äôs what makes it B2B). Examples include Snowflake, Slack, and Jira.B2B SaaS businesses typically monetize in one of two ways‚Äîper seat (e.g. Slack) or by usage (e.g. Datadog)‚Äîand grow in one of two ways‚Äîthrough a bottom-up motion (i.e. individual employees within a company discover the product on their own, as with Figma and Notion) or a top-down motion (i.e. salespeople sell the product into company leaders, as with Salesforce and Box). And though not exactly the same thing, a bottom-up growth motion is, in practice, essentially the same as a ‚Äúproduct-led growth‚Äù (PLG) motion. Below, we‚Äôll look at the three most common B2B SaaS business models, sharing both a simplified version of each business equation (as an image) and the full equation in the text under it.1. Bottom-up B2B SaaS with seat-based pricingExamples: Figma, Slack, Zoom, Adobe Creative Cloud, Asana, Jira.ARR = New ARR + Expansion ARR + Reactivation ARR ‚Äì Churned ARR ‚Äì Contraction ARRNew ARR = New seats * price per seatNew seats = Visitors * conversion to trial/freemium * conversion to paid * seats per accountVisitorsPaid adsSEODirect (e.g. word of mouth, virality)Referral (e.g. G2, social, articles)Turbo boostsConversion to trial/freemiumVisit to CTACTA to signupSignup to activationConversion to paidAwareness of paid planStarting the purchase process to completing the purchase processValue of productLead nurturingExpansion ARR = Accounts upsold * average price increaseAccounts upsoldIn-product upsellsOutboundHitting limitsAverage price increaseSeat growthHeadcount growthInternal viralityColleague invite rateInvite conversion rateCross-sold products (e.g. Figma -> FigJam)Hitting more expensive tiersRaising pricesReactivation ARRReactivated logosReactivated seatsChurned ARRChurned logosContraction ARRSeat contractionDowngrading tiersStopped using additional products2.

Top-down (sales-led) B2B SaaSExamples: Snowflake, Box, Salesforce, Workday, LookerThis category includes both seat-based and usage-based pricing and normally ends up as a predetermined negotiated annual contract.ARR = New ARR + Expansion ARR + Reactivation ARR ‚Äì Churned ARR ‚Äì Contraction ARRNew ARR = Leads * qualified leads rate * meeting booked rate * win rate * ACVLeads = Direct + indirectDirect = Outbound + inboundOutboundCold emailsCold callsCold DMsEventsInboundPaid adsSEOReferrals (e.g. G2, backlink, social mentions)Direct (e.g. signs up for demo on website)Turbo boostsIndirectChannel partnershipsNumber of partnershipsLeads per partnerConversion rateExpansion ARR = Accounts upsold * average price increaseAccounts upsoldIn-product upsellsSales nurturingHitting limitsAverage price increaseSeat/usage growthHeadcount growthInternal viralityColleague invite rateInvite conversion rateData/customer/use-cases growthCross-sold products (e.g. Figma -> FigJam)Hitting more expensive tiersRaising pricesReactivation ARRReactivated logosReactivated usersChurned ARRChurned logosContraction ARRReduced seats/usageDowngrading tiersStopped using additional productsB2C/consumer equationsConsumer businesses make a software product for individual consumers. Examples include Netflix, TikTok, and Google.Consumer products typically monetize in one of two ways‚Äîsubscriptions (e.g. Duolingo, Spotify, Tinder) and ads (e.g. Instagram, Snap, YouTube). Below, we‚Äôll look at these two models.4. B2C with subscription-based pricing (trial or freemium)Examples: Duolingo, Spotify, Tinder, Calm, Strava, MyFitnessPalARR = MRR x 12 = (New subs + Retained subs + Reactivated subs) * Average monthly revenue per sub * 12New subs = Traffic * visit to trial/freemium conversion * trial to paid conversionTrafficPaid adsSEODirect/WOMReferrals (i.e. invites)¬†Turbo boostsVisit to trial/freemium conversionVisit to onboardingOnboarding to activationTrial to paid conversionAwareness of paid planStarting to purchase to completing purchaseRetained subsReactivated subsAverage monthly revenue per sub% annual vs. monthly subs% premium vs. basic subs5.

Examples include Airbnb, DoorDash, Uber, eBay, and Faire.These businesses don‚Äôt own the supply (e.g. the homes, the cars, the restaurants) but instead make it easy for customers to find and purchase from these sellers.Marketplaces monetize primarily through a transaction fee and occasionally through a subscription fee.There are two types of marketplaces‚ÄîB2C marketplaces, which cater to individual consumer customers (e.g. Airbnb, Uber), and B2B marketplaces, which cater to business customers (e.g. Faire, Pachama).6.

DTC/e-commerce equationFinally, we have direct-to-consumer (DTC) and e-commerce businesses, which sell a physical product to individuals. This includes companies like Warby Parker, Casper, Glossier, and Dollar Shave Club.Revenue = Transactions * AOVTransactions = Traffic * conversion rateTraffic = New traffic + returning trafficNew trafficPaid adsSEODirect (e.g. WOM, virality)Turbo boostsReturning trafficQuality of product and experienceRe-engagement (upsell/cross-sell)Conversion rateVisit to searchSearch to product pageProduct page to start checkoutStart checkout to complete purchaseAOV (average order value)Adding margin to your business equationFor any business with sufficiently high cost of sales, you can‚Äôt stop at revenue. What you‚Äôre really optimizing for is contribution margin, or what is left over after you take out all variable costs of a transaction.This is a key metric because it describes how much you have left over to reinvest in the business. It‚Äôs also how more margin-intensive businesses will typically ultimately be valued, as opposed to high-margin businesses, like SaaS, which are often valued on multiples of ARR.To apply margin to the equations above, all you have to do is calculate your average contribution margin rate (CM%) and multiply it by revenue. So for a DTC business, the formula would be:Contribution margin = Transactions * AOV * CM%There are two big components of cost to consider. Deducting only the first would give you a gross margin, and including the second gets you to contribution margin.Direct variable costs: These are costs that are directly driven by a transaction and are easy to attribute. For DTC models, this would include things like cost of goods sold, incentives, and shipping. For marketplace models, it would include things like payment processing fees, incentives, and defaults.Indirect variable costs: These are costs that are not directly driven by transactions but tend to increase as transactions increase, and include things like marketing and customer support.¬†Calculating payback periodFor every business model here, one of the most important metrics that is not directly covered in these equations is customer acquisition payback period, i.e. the amount of time it takes for you to recoup the costs of customer acquisition. This is a better measure than LTV/CAC because it tells you how quickly you can invest in driving more growth.At the highest level, you can calculate payback period as CAC divided by annual contribution margin per customer. For example, if you have a CAC of $100 and an average annual contribution margin per customer of $120, your payback period would be 0.83 years, or 10 months.For certain business models, especially marketplaces, this equation gets more complicated. See ‚Äúproblem #2‚Äù in this essay for an explanation of how to calculate payback periods for marketplaces. Also, here are handy benchmarks for good and great payback periods.üìö Further studyThe ultimate guide to product-led sales, with Elena VernaThe SaaS Metrics That Matter, by David SacksThe Burn Multiple, by David SacksDrive Growth by Picking the Right Lane‚ÄîA Customer Acquisition Playbook for Consumer Startups, by Dan Hockenmaier and Lenny RachitskyHow to kickstart and scale a consumer businessHow to kickstart and scale a marketplace businessHow to kickstart and scale a B2B businessHave a fulfilling and productive week üôèüëÄ Hiring?

Adding a work trial to your interview process

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeP.S. Don‚Äôt miss Lennybot ‚ú® (an AI chatbot trained on my newsletter posts, podcast interviews, and more) and my new swag store (makes great gifts!).Q: I‚Äôve noticed ‚Äúwork trials‚Äù have come up a few times on your podcast. I‚Äôm sold on the benefits and want to explore this at my company. What advice do you have for setting up a successful work trial process?Indeed they have. Karri Saarinen (CEO of Linear) mentioned they run candidates through work trials, as did Jason Fried (co-founder and CEO of 37signals). When I asked folks on Twitter who else they‚Äôve seen do a great job with work trials, I learned that trials have also been a longtime practice at Automattic, Gumroad, Auth0 (now part of Okta), PostHog, and a number of other companies. Work trials aren‚Äôt a new concept, but they do seem to be trending.To get you an answer, I interviewed the founders of the six companies most known for work trials, and from their collective wisdom put together a guide for building your own work trial process:What exactly is a ‚Äúwork trial‚Äù?Why do work trials?What are examples of good trial projects?How do they fit into the overall interview process?Should you pay candidates, and, if so, how much?How do you evaluate a candidate‚Äôs performance?How do you convince people to invest this much time in an interview?Lessons for implementing your work trialA big thank-you to Matt Mullenweg (Automattic), Jason Fried (37signals), Karri Saarinen and Cristina Cordova (Linear), Sahil Lavingia (Gumroad), James Hawkins (PostHog), and Matias Woloski (Auth0/Okta) for their insights and advice üôèWhat exactly is a ‚Äúwork trial‚Äù?A work trial refers to a step in the interview process where candidates are asked to complete a project that‚Äôs representative of the work they‚Äôll be doing in the role. The ‚Äúrepresentativeness‚Äù falls on a spectrum, from doing an in-depth project at home (e.g. 37signals) to co-working with existing employees in the real codebase building something the company will ship (e.g. Linear).Where you fall on the spectrum of how close to reality your work trial should be is directly correlated with the size of your company. The fewer people you‚Äôre hiring (and thus the more important each hire is), the more time you should be investing in a work trial. As you grow, you can streamline the process.Why do a work trial?Simple: it gives you significantly more signal on the candidate.As James Hawkins (co-founder and CEO of PostHog) shared, ‚ÄúIt makes it obvious who to hire. It is frequently surprising how someone performs relative to what we thought in the interviews about their skills.‚ÄùLinear found that the only way they could know if the candidate was a fit for their unique culture was by co-working with them:‚ÄúThe majority of companies don‚Äôt work in the way we do, which leads to fewer people with these kinds of skills. A conventional interview process, often modeled by large companies, doesn‚Äôt account for this. It‚Äôs challenging to assess in interviews if someone is truly a builder, has good taste and judgment, can take initiative, and approaches problems productively.‚Äù ‚ÄîKarri Saarinen, LinearThis is the same conclusion Automattic eventually came to:‚ÄúThe more we thought about why some hires succeeded and some didn‚Äôt, the more we recognized that there is no substitute for working alongside someone in the trenches. We recognized we were being influenced by aspects of an interview‚Äîsuch as someone‚Äôs manner of speaking or behavior in a restaurant‚Äîthat have no bearing on how a candidate will actually perform. Some people are amazing interviewees and charm everyone they talk to. But if the job isn‚Äôt going to involve charming others, their interview skills don‚Äôt predict how well they‚Äôll do as employees. Just like work, interviews can be ‚Äòperformed‚Äô without real productivity. So we gradually changed our approach.‚Äù ‚ÄîMatt Mullenweg, founder and CEOWork trials not only help you better gauge the candidate‚Äôs skill set, they also help you understand how much the candidate wants to work at your company, as Matias, Sahil, and Matt pointed out:‚ÄúIt did mean that we might miss out on some people who couldn‚Äôt make the time for it, but because at a startup, commitment‚Äîand wanting it‚Äîis very important, it was a good filter.‚Äù ‚ÄîMatias Woloski, co-founder and CTO of Auth0‚ÄúThe trial is about their work. But it‚Äôs also about them seeing all the internals of the company, culture, finances, my attitude, etc.‚Äù ‚ÄîSahil Lavingia, founder and CEO of Gumroad‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a two-way street. It allows us to be as confident as possible in making a decision and enables the person interviewing to do the same thing.‚Äù ‚ÄîMatt Mullenweg, founder and CEO of AutomatticWhat are examples of good trial projects?Karri Saarinen best summarized the recurring lesson across my interviews:‚ÄúThe goal with the work trial is to simulate a normal working environment as much as possible.‚ÄùGumroad wins for taking this idea furthest by hiring the candidates as contractors for 4 to 6 weeks. As Sahil Lavingia put it, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so very hard a priori to know if someone can do the job. So we just pay them to do it!‚ÄùThroughout the year, the Gumroad team marks certain tasks on their roadmap as ‚Äúgood for trialers‚Äù and then they assign these tasks to interview candidates. ‚ÄúGenerally,‚Äù Sahil said, ‚Äúthey ship a lot of small bug fixes and stuff. For example, we have a current trialer working on adding wishlists to Gumroad, which is a pretty big feature. Shan recently passed with flying colors, and here‚Äôs an update to give a sense of the work trialers do‚Äù:As part of this trial, Gumroad gives candidates access to their internal tools, including their local GitHub, Figma, Notion, Slack, etc.‚ÄúAnother way to look at work trials is, you‚Äôre hired by default but will likely be fired in 30 to 60 days if you don‚Äôt perform like the rest of the team by the end of that time limit.‚Äù ‚ÄîSahil LavingiaLinear comes in a close second in terms of realism by having candidates co-work with their future team for 3 to 5 days, in the actual codebase, also with access to the company‚Äôs GitHub, Figma, Slack, and Notion accounts.‚ÄúWe assemble a supporting project team, including a recruiter, the hiring manager, and 3 to 5 teammates who would closely intersect with this role once they‚Äôre hired.Our recruiter and people operations coordinator handle necessary logistics pre-trial, like securing a non-disclosure agreement, granting temporary tool access, scheduling meetings, and prepping docs conveying context on goals and expectations.Work trial projects sometimes end up being the first project for the new hire when they get started.‚Äù ‚ÄîKarri SaarinenExamples of projects Linear gives candidates:For an engineer, building a feature allowing teams to effectively triage incoming feature requestsFor a content marketer, writing a blog post based on a feature release (which they shipped part 2 of to production recently after the candidate was hired)For a designer, designing a way to resolve comments:Linear‚Äôs actual prompt for past designer candidatesAutomattic, Auth0, and PostHog used to operate like Linear and Gumroad, bringing the candidate on part-time to work alongside existing employees for some number of days, but as they‚Äôve grown, they‚Äôve tweaked their trial process to be more time-efficient and standardized.‚ÄúOur work trial task will be representative of the day-to-day work someone in the role at PostHog does, but it isn‚Äôt actual work we‚Äôd use or ship. It used to be actual work. We changed it to representative work because:Actual work comes with tricky implications around things like IP ownership, needing to hire them as contractors, etc.The codebase is now way too big and complex for this to be practical.Tasks are generally designed to be too much work for one person to complete in a day, in order to get a sense of the candidate‚Äôs ability to prioritize, and they‚Äôre open-ended as per above.‚Äù ‚ÄîJames Hawkins, CEOHere‚Äôs an example project PostHog assigned a recent PM candidate, which they complete at home and then present to the hiring team:At Automattic, they also used to give candidates access to the actual codebase, but as Matt Mullenweg told me, ‚Äúit lacked consistency and was hard to scale. These days, for more generic engineering roles, we set up¬†a separate repository with an already forked, smaller project, which is better controlled in terms of candidate experience, code, tasks, and access.The project scope also varies, but it will be as close to the actual work as possible. If you‚Äôre an engineer, you‚Äôll be writing real code. If you‚Äôre a designer, you‚Äôll design.In some cases, there‚Äôs a real-world project they‚Äôll work on. However, in many cases, folks will work on a ‚Äòsynthetic‚Äô project that simulates the work they‚Äôll do very closely without waiting for a suitable project to come up. Several people are usually involved in the process. There‚Äôs always a Lead who is the main point of contact for the candidate. The others involved are the folks the candidate would interact with most. This could be anywhere from two to six people (or more), depending on the role. For more interactive roles, such as Sales or positions where folks will be presenting internally, the trial project may include a final presentation. Mostly, however, the work is done asynchronously. Folks are also set up on Slack and P2¬†(our internal communication tool) so they can get used to the tools we use, communicate how they need to, and have access to all the information they need.‚ÄùHere‚Äôs a blog post snippet from an engineering candidate who went through the Automattic work trial:Auth0 used to do an in-depth take-home exercise, as Matias Woloski (co-founder and CTO) shared:‚ÄúThe project was typically from a real-world situation we faced and solved in the past. This allowed us to know the ins and outs of the problem, which is useful when assessing and guiding candidates. We‚Äôd reuse the same exercise across all levels and adjust expectations. For positions we didn‚Äôt hire for often (e.g. Director of Infrastructure), we‚Äôd make up the exercise when a few candidates reached that stage in the pipeline.‚ÄùHere‚Äôs an example project prompt for an engineering role at Auth0 (high-res copy here):However, a couple of years ago, after being acquired by Okta, Auth0 moved away from these projects in favor of shorter exercises, fully knowing they would get less signal on candidates:This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

Art by Natalie Harney.For this step, I‚Äôll focus on the four most common hiring questions I get from early-stage founders:Who should I hire first?Where do I find them?How do I convince them to join?When should I hire a salesperson (and what should I look for)?1. Who to hireI asked all the founders I interviewed who their first 10 hires were:Let‚Äôs break this down by your first hire, first three hires, and first 10.Who to hire as employee #1Takeaway: Developers, developers, developers, developers. Over two-thirds of the companies hired an engineer as employee #1. Not a big surprise.In the rare case when an engineer wasn‚Äôt the first hire, it usually came down to the founding team having enough horsepower to build the V1.‚ÄúHaving four founders who could stretch across the business helped a lot here. Each of us could write code, handle customer success, write product specs, and work across the stack.‚Äù ‚ÄîCalvin French-Owen, co-founder of SegmentFounders were instead able to de-risk, or un-bottleneck, something else. Vanta hired a compliance subject-matter expert as their first employee:‚ÄúWe could build, but we wanted the check on are we building the right thing, given our background wasn‚Äôt in the space. The worst case would have been promising to get a company ‚Äòsecure and compliant‚Äô and then failing to do so!‚Äù ‚ÄîChristina Cacioppo, co-founder and CEO of VantaCoda hired a recruiter:‚ÄúI‚Äôd say that our first hires were all fairly typical, except for hiring a Head of Recruiting at such an early stage of development. It was earlier than anticipated, but a good friend introduced me to Kenny Mendes and said, ‚ÄòI know it‚Äôs early, but people like Kenny don‚Äôt come along often, so you should probably pull him in.‚Äô That turned out to be a fantastic choice, as Kenny has turned out to be an amazing generalist and quickly became chief operating officer for us.‚Äù ‚ÄîShishir Mehrotra, co-founder and CEOSprig hired an AI data scientist, and Segment and Amplitude hired a customer success/support person as employee #1. Here‚Äôs Calvin French-Owen (co-founder of Segment) on why they did this:‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something really magical when you write in to a startup and they fix your issue within a few hours. It‚Äôs something you‚Äôd never, ever expect from a big company, and it was one way for us to differentiate.¬†So initially, the four of us basically round-robined¬†support. We‚Äôd log in to Help Scout and answer as many emails as possible. We‚Äôd switch off whoever answered the handful of Olark live chats¬†that would pop in throughout the day. By the middle of the year, we were getting slammed with fairly technical support requests from users. They‚Äôd run the gamut from the relatively easy ‚ÄòWhat analytics tool should I use?‚Äô to the more technical ‚ÄòI‚Äôm running Python on App Engine; why aren‚Äôt my events making it to Segment?‚ÄôTo give us extra engineering bandwidth, Peter [Reinhardt, the CEO] spent about eight weeks handling all the support volume on his own. But it basically meant he couldn‚Äôt do anything else.¬†We wanted to find someone who could handle most of these requests on their own and synthesize any new requests. Jake [Peterson] (who we hired for the role) was a bit of a unicorn in that respect. He had run his own analytics consultancy that was focused on helping customers reduce their costs and had a little bit of technical ability to read code. He wrote good docs and authored a bunch of our early blog content.Given the breadth of integrations we supported, and the fact that we had four technical co-founders, we hired early here.‚ÄùThe first three hiresTakeaways:Engineers continued to be the predominant function across the first three hires. Not shown in the chart, but 100% of companies hired at least one engineer among their first three hires.Interestingly, customer success/support continues to be a popular role for the first three hires. Of the non-engineer hires, almost a quarter of them are customer success/support. For me, this ties directly to the core lesson from part five‚Äîget companies to love your product.Subject-matter experts also continue to be a surprisingly common early hire, particularly for startups building in a complex regulatory-oriented market (e.g. Gusto, Zip, and Vanta).Although only 10% of hires were designers, and this isn‚Äôt shown in the pie chart above, over 40% of companies hired a designer in their first three hires, or had a designer co-founder.Very few companies hired a salesperson among the first three.Three companies hired a PM within their first three hires: Coda, Persona, and Snyk. Here‚Äôs Guy Podjarny, founder and CEO of Snyk, on why they hired a PM so early:‚ÄúI believed the fact that security products weren‚Äôt fit for developers was a product problem, not a tech problem, needing breakthroughs more in the UX world than tech algorithms. Furthermore, I had two technical co-founders that I knew would lead the security and tech aspects well, so felt I‚Äôm well-covered there.¬†I could have done the product work myself (and in practice, I did a portion of it), but I wanted to free myself up to build the company as a whole, and not be too focused on one aspect of it. I did hire someone with deep UX skills, better than mine, who complemented me, not just offloaded work.In general, I intentionally took the path of building¬†a strong leadership team early on. It was always a very hands-on leadership team, who initially spent most of their time as ICs but were also building teams and practices. This is a personal choice, and many founders prefer to directly manage most of the team until it grows. For me, however, I perceive myself as a better leader and innovator than I am a manager, and I wanted to focus my attention there.‚ÄùAnd here‚Äôs Rick Song, founder and CEO of Persona, on hiring a PM as employee #1:‚ÄúWe hired Vincent [Tsao] because Charles and I believed his professional experience and willingness to give it his all were a perfect fit. We would‚Äôve wanted to work with him whether at Persona or elsewhere, and that speaks highly of our rapport. He had experience from a previous startup and understood the fluid nature of a company‚Äôs early stages‚Äîhe wasn‚Äôt tied to a specific role, title, or set of responsibilities and understood that we were all going to do whatever it took to succeed. In fact, his very first project had nothing to do with product- he spent the first evening setting up payroll!We also believe that many founders, in their eagerness to launch and iterate, often swing too far on the pendulum of no documentation or process. While Charles and I were confident in our product and market insights as well as our ability as engineers to create a MVP, we were also self-aware about our shortcomings. We knew we needed someone with not only sharp product intuition but also someone who could anchor our product operations and knowledge base, synthesizing insights from chaos and ultimately helping us move faster. Vincent was invaluable in building the foundation that enabled us to smoothly go from MVP to product market fit, and eventually, to scaling our team.‚ÄùThe first 10 hiresTakeaways:Sales becomes the second most common hire, after engineering.A quarter of companies hired a product manager at this point.Recruiters become a surprisingly common hire. I did not expect that. This is particularly true across some of the most unique startups, like Linear, Figma, Ramp, and Coda. Here‚Äôs Jori Lallo, co-founder of Linear, on why they hired a recruiter so early:‚ÄúInitially all of us three founders ran the recruiting process, and while it worked for a little while, it wasn‚Äôt something we were necessarily particularly good at or passionate about. We cared about hiring the best people, not about the first person who came knocking at our door. Also, we didn‚Äôt really have the tools or the time to reach outside our own networks, so we needed help to expand outside the inbound applicant pool.At first we experimented with a couple of external boutique recruiting agencies, but it didn‚Äôt feel natural. This was mainly due to a consulting recruitment model where incentives are often tied to closed hires, so the recruiters are incentivized to make the hires as fast as possible. This is good for growing the team fast but hard when you want to hire only the best talent. The best and most sought-after people are often hard and slow to hire, and the process looks more like leadership recruiting.So building the function in-house and investing into it made sense to us. We probably weren‚Äôt great at it at first but have since come a long way. Today we have a four-person recruiting function at a 50-person company.‚Äù2. Where to find your early employeesOnce you have a sense of which roles to hire, how (and where) do you find amazing people? I asked each founder how they found their early employees. Their answers all fell into four channels:Channel 1: Friends and former colleaguesUnsurprisingly, hiring friends and former colleagues was by far the biggest channel. This also in part explains why multi-time founders, and anyone with a large network (e.g. Y Combinator), have an advantage:‚ÄúAll of our early hires were friends/ex-coworkers.‚Äù‚ÄúFirst hires were practically all former colleagues. Several people who worked with me in my previous company reached out when they heard I was into something new, with my co-founder.‚Äù ‚ÄúAbout half the early hires came from my personal network (friends from school, ex-coworkers, etc.).‚Äù‚ÄúI thought about the hardest-working people I knew and reached out to them.‚ÄùBut not so fast. There‚Äôs also a downside to this path, as shared by Segment and Linear:‚ÄúWe tried for a long time to hire former classmates (we were fresh out of college, so had no former colleagues), but we had pretty rotten luck. Believe it or not, there was little appetite to join four crazy guys in a room who had been failing for two years straight :)‚Äù ‚ÄîCalvin French-Owen, co-founder of Segment ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt end up hiring people from our past jobs, which might be more common for others. All of us founders worked for more established startups before Linear, and we looked for people who would do well in an early-stage environment. Among our first 10 hires were several founders (including two who had gone through YC). We still look for generalists and people with experience and who deeply care about their craft.‚Äù ‚ÄîJori Lallo, co-founder of LinearChannel 2: Cold outreachI was surprised to learn that the second most common channel for finding early employees is cold outreach‚Äîfinding people you want to hire and reaching out to them directly. These outreaches happened mostly through LinkedIn and GitHub, and unlike channel #1, this is something anyone can do.‚ÄúWe filled many roles through cold hard outbound on LinkedIn.‚Äù‚ÄúWe reached out directly to people (mainly engineering) that had significant public experience with parts of the product we were developing, i.e. visualizations.‚Äù‚ÄúWe had great luck finding people off GitHub. These were folks who had contributed to repos we were watching, and we had decent evidence that they were good. They didn‚Äôt come from FAANG, they had solid contributions in open-source land, they paid a lot of attention to abstractions and were really productive. Most of them had worked at one or two prior startups, but in general we bet on people looking to make their next big leap.‚ÄùChannel 3: Job boardsAlso, surprisingly, a lot of early hires were found by posting roles on public job boards‚Äîagain, something every founder can do. By far the most mentioned job board was AngelList. Also mentioned were Triplebyte, Facebook groups, and VCs‚Äô internal job boards. Shoutout: If you‚Äôre looking for the best jobs in town, check out Lenny‚Äôs Job Board! üòÖChannel 4: Friends and former colleagues of your employeesA final channel, which, if you recall, was also useful for finding your early customers, was tapping the networks of your early employees.‚ÄúMany of our early hires were people from my network or the network of the very first employees.‚Äù‚ÄúOur second sales hire was a former colleague of our first salesperson.‚ÄùI didn‚Äôt get many interesting quotes for this channel, but it was a fruitful one for many founders, and worth spending time on.3. How to convince people to join your startupI actually researched and covered this in a previous issue, so go read that post. Here‚Äôs the high-level summary of what you need to get right:Captivating vision‚ÄîMake it easy for candidates to visualize what you are building toward and to feel like their work will be meaningful.A++ early team‚ÄîThe best talent attracts the best talent.Put in the time‚ÄîBe prepared to commit 50 to 100 hours for each hire you make.Grow your network‚ÄîIt‚Äôll be an easier sell if they know you (or know someone who knows you).Love bomb‚ÄîGo the extra mile when trying to close a candidate:‚ÄúWe see the actual offer stage as a big place you can stand out. We do a Zoom to surprise the candidate with everyone from their interview panel to share why they‚Äôre excited about the candidate potentially joining.‚Äù ‚ÄîJulianna Lamb, co-founder and CTO of Stytch4. When to hire a salesperson, and what to look forAlways start with founder-led salesEvery founder I spoke to started with founder-led sales‚Äîdoing the sales themselves until they reached a certain milestone.David Hsu (founder and CEO of Retool) shared why he found this so valuable:This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

They have helped more than 300 teams design new products and bring them to market, including those at YouTube, Gusto, One Medical Group, and Slack. Jake and John are co-founders of the venture capital firm Character, where they support startups with capital and sprints. Previously, they were operating partners at Google Ventures and, before that, design leaders at Google, where John worked on Google Ads and YouTube and Jake helped build Gmail and co-founded Google Meet. In our conversation, we discuss:‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúBusy bandwagon‚Äù and ‚Äúinfinity pools‚Äù‚Ä¢ Creating one ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù each day‚Ä¢ Their four-part framework for productivity‚Ä¢ How to use the calendar to design your day‚Ä¢ How creating friction can help you avoid distractions‚Ä¢ Tips on creating a distraction-free phone‚Ä¢ Strategies for managing email and distractions‚Ä¢ The importance of reflecting on the day and making time for meaningful work‚Ä¢ Design sprintsSome takeaways:The foundation of ‚Äúmaking time‚Äù is to define and write down a ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù each day. This is the one thing that would make your whole day a success if you get it done. Highlights can be professional or personal. Once you know your highlights, you can shape your days around them.Try using your calendar to block out the time you spend on different tasks. Firstly, this will help you understand how long things really take (the results may surprise you). Secondly, it will help you block out time for deep work by conveying to yourself and others when you want to avoid interruptions.Reflect on your productivity with curiosity rather than judgment. Each day is an experiment that you‚Äôll get to run again tomorrow and the day after that. If you don‚Äôt complete a highlight one day, instead of beating yourself up, ask, ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Find the lesson you can apply the next day, and feel free to set the same highlight again.Be aware of the busy bandwagon and infinity pools that can distract you. The busy bandwagon is the societal expectation that everyone should be busy, leading to stress and a constant feeling of needing to be occupied. Infinity pools are endless sources of content and distractions, such as social media and emails, designed to be compelling and friction-free, making it easy to get sucked in. Understanding these concepts can empower you to take control of your time and increase productivity.The ‚ÄúMake Time‚Äù frameworkHighlight: Identify and prioritize the most crucial task for the day‚Äîthe highlight that deserves your primary attention.Laser: Create barriers to distractions, allowing you to channel as much energy and attention as possible toward your highlighted task.Energize: Choose a time when your energy levels are high. Take intentional steps to maintain your well-being, including sufficient sleep, proper nutrition, exercise, and social interaction. This component acts as a booster to the Laser focus.Reflect: Consistently reflect on your approach, adjusting tactics as needed. Treat each day as an experiment rather than a judgment of success or failure.Listen now on Apple, Spotify, Overcast, and YouTube.Find the full transcript at: https://www.lennyspodcast.com/making-time-for-what-matters-jake-knapp-and-john-zeratsky-authors-of-sprint-and-make-time-co-fou/Where to find Jake Knapp:‚Ä¢ X: https://twitter.com/jakek‚Ä¢ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-knapp/‚Ä¢ Website: https://jakeknapp.com/Where to find John Zeratsky:‚Ä¢ X: https://twitter.com/jazer‚Ä¢ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnzeratsky/‚Ä¢ Website: https://johnzeratsky.com/Where to find Lenny:‚Ä¢ Newsletter: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com‚Ä¢ X: https://twitter.com/lennysan‚Ä¢ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennyrachitsky/In this episode, we cover:(00:00) About Jake and John (04:10) Recording the audiobook for Make Time (06:06) What people often get wrong when trying to become more productive (11:24) The busy bandwagon and infinity pools (15:22) Real talk: Jake and John‚Äôs productivity levels (20:10) The four-part framework for getting more done: Highlight, Laser, Energize, Reflect (25:15) Step 1: Highlight (28:08) Designing your day with a calendar (30:52) The Groundhog Day mentality (35:10) Tactical advice for implementing the highlight method (39:30) An example of a failed highlight (48:08) Step 2: Laser (51:12) Creating intentional friction to avoid distractions (57:28) Curating a distraction-free phone (01:07:58) Resetting expectations and slowing your inbox (01:14:51) Systems over willpower (01:18:14) Managing email distractions (01:18:49) Step 3: Energize (01:22:05) Step 4: Reflect (01:26:30) Introduction to SprintReferenced:‚Ä¢ Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day: https://www.amazon.com/Make-Time-Focus-Matters-Every/dp/0525572422‚Ä¢ Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days: https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-audiobook/dp/B019R2DQIY‚Ä¢ Make Time blog: https://maketime.blog/‚Ä¢ Make Time blog on X: https://twitter.com/maketimeblog‚Ä¢ Character: https://www.character.vc/‚Ä¢ Google Ventures: https://www.gv.com/‚Ä¢ Character Labs: https://www.character.vc/labs‚Ä¢ Strategies for becoming less distracted and improving focus | Nir Eyal (author of Indistractable and Hooked): https://www.lennyspodcast.com/strategies-for-becoming-less-distracted-and-improving-focus-nir-eyal-author-of-indistractable-and/‚Ä¢ Groundhog Day on Prime Video: https://www.amazon.com/Groundhog-Day-Bill-Murray/dp/B000SP1SH6‚Ä¢ Reclaim.ai: https://reclaim.ai/‚Ä¢ Feed Blocker for LinkedIn: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/feed-blocker-for-linkedin/eikaafmldiioljlilngpogcepiedpenf‚Ä¢ The Lord of the Rings: https://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/0544003411‚Ä¢ MagSafe charger: https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG/‚Ä¢ Nanit app: https://www.nanit.com/pages/nanit-app‚Ä¢ Arianna Huffington‚Äôs Phone Bed Charging Station: https://www.amazon.com/Arianna-Huffingtons-Charging-Station-Walnut/dp/B0799ZG1LY‚Ä¢ Cell Phone Lock Box with Timer: https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Android-Self-Discipline-Achieve-Addiction/dp/B0CG8V4YG3?th=1‚Ä¢ The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich: https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Live-Anywhere/dp/0307465357‚Ä¢ The Economist: https://www.economist.com/‚Ä¢ Odysseus: https://www.britannica.com/topic/Odysseus‚Ä¢ Mailman: https://www.mailmanhq.com/‚Ä¢ Future: https://www.future.co/‚Ä¢ Notion: https://www.notion.so/‚Ä¢ Miro: https://miro.com/Lightning-round answers:2-3 books you‚Äôve recommended most to people?John: Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath, Rapt by Winifred Gallagher, Good Strategy/Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt.Jake: The Power of Moments by Chip and Dan Heath, The Happiness Project by Gretchen Rubin, Listen Like You Mean It by Ximena VengoecheaFavorite recent movie or TV show?John: Succession (I‚Äôve seen it three times).Jake: Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among¬†Thieves, BBC‚Äôs Pride and Prejudice‚Äînot recent (1995) but rewatched recently.Favorite interview question you like to ask candidates?John: (For founders) What were the biggest risks you had to overcome in building this business, and what are the next set of important hypotheses you need to validate?Jake: (For¬†founders) Why are you doing this with your life right now?

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeP.S. Don‚Äôt miss Lennybot, my AI chatbot that‚Äôs trained on every newsletter post and podcast interview.I recently heard about an app called¬†Saturn¬†that reached the top of the App Store charts‚Äîand stayed there. This is incredibly rare. As I dug in and chatted with the founders, I was blown away by how methodically they were able to articulate what it takes to build a viral consumer app (particularly one targeted at Gen Z). They launched the company back in 2019, while still students at the University of Pennsylvania, and today have scaled the app to millions of users and nearly 20,000 schools. Their cap table is also unreal and includes General Catalyst, Insight, Coatue, Dick Costolo and Adam Bain‚Äôs 01 Advisors, and folks like Marc Benioff (CEO and co-founder of Salesforce), Dara Khosrowshahi (CEO of Uber), Ashton Kutcher, Robert Downey Jr., Mike Vernal (Sequoia), Bezos Expeditions (the personal investment company of Jeff Bezos), Elad Gil, and Dylan Field (CEO and co-founder of Figma). I‚Äôm not an investor, but I wish I were.Below, co-founders Dylan Diamond and Max Baron share their biggest lessons on building a viral social consumer app, including:Embracing single-player mode as a wedge for social productsBuilding a product that users feel was built just for themWhy it‚Äôs OK to be unscalable‚Äîyou can make it scale laterBuilding a familiar product is much easier if you‚Äôre solving a problem you‚Äôve experiencedPlaying the long gameI spend most of my time looking for patterns across many successful companies, but often you can learn more by studying a single example in depth. This is an excellent example of the latter.For more on Saturn, check out joinsaturn.com.Saturn is a social network built around the calendar. We started in high schools by building the most powerful real-time calendar ever made exclusively for students. Today we support millions of students at nearly 20,000 schools across the country, entirely bottom-up through the students themselves, without a single school partnership.It took years to build critical mass by launching at enough schools to see a significant inflection in our growth and the development of real network effects. This August, we reached fourth overall in Apple‚Äôs App Store and second on the Social Networking charts, while maintaining a tailored and closed network for each school.Saturn reached #2 in the Social Networking section and #4 overall in mid-August 2023.We have a long way to go and millions more students to support, but here are a few lessons we‚Äôve learned that might be useful in building your own consumer social product.¬†Quick note/disclaimer: No two apps, or growth journeys, are going to be exactly the same‚Äîso these lessons won‚Äôt be directly interchangeable, but hopefully you can draw from some of them in making your own product and go-to-market decisions. We also note some of the (many) lessons we‚Äôve learned from other major social networks and social utilities since getting started ourselves in 2019.1. Embrace a single-player mode as a wedge for social productsMany people talk about the value of a ‚Äúsingle-player mode.‚Äù The reason is simple: it usually unlocks retention, and retention unlocks time‚Äîtime to iterate and improve on your product. In our case, having a single-player mode gave us more time to launch and refine key social features that improved the network effects of our product. Great retention reduces the cost of making mistakes, and allows you to take bigger risks and learn faster.Chris Dixon wrote about this in a 2015 piece called ‚ÄúCome for the tool, stay for the network,‚Äù observing that ‚Äústarting a network from scratch is very hard. Think of single-player tools as kindling.‚ÄùFrom the beginning, Saturn combined a (primary) single-player utility as a user‚Äôs daily calendar with a multiplayer or ‚Äúsocial‚Äù value that came from being able to see what your friends were doing during the high school day. Over time, we‚Äôve introduced new utility and social use cases and continue to invest in those, but our retentive hook has remained a calendar, originally single-player, eventually multiplayer, that perfectly supports each school.Saturn‚Äôs core surfaces provide clear single-player utility by answering some of the age-old questions high schoolers ask each and every day.Since we started Saturn, many apps have achieved ‚Äúhypergrowth‚Äù in various demographics with novel multiplayer social features and more impressive K-factors than ours, but, without a retentive single-player utility, most of them seem to have experienced a destructive inverse K-factor as well. As your friends start leaving, the product quickly gets significantly worse. That decay in value is nonlinear. Early departures disproportionally worsen the overall value of the network.Here‚Äôs an example of how this happens: A new app is super-popular. All of your friends are posting to it once a day. Over the course of a weekend, three of those friends don‚Äôt post‚Äîit‚Äôs not a coordinated effort, but they just aren‚Äôt motivated by the notification loops and existing content. Suddenly the library of available (and relevant) content has been significantly reduced, and the product as a whole has become significantly less compelling. Over the coming days, another three people open the app, just to check in, but don‚Äôt feel like they need to post. In the span of just a few days, you‚Äôve lost 60% of your creators, and for those final four users, the product is a shell of what it was just a few days before.When the value of an app is almost entirely social, any change in the network will have outsized effects on its overall health. When a network starts shrinking, things spiral quickly, and when a few of your friends stop creating or participating, there is less of a pull for you to participate.These are products with great social loops but lack a legitimate single-player use case that keeps you coming back. This rarely works out. You want to build a product where users can survive in smaller pockets‚Äîor, better still, alone. Saturn works well even if you are alone, since our calendar provides single-player value and helps you manage your schedule, regardless of how many others may be on the platform. This shows in our new-user retention across the whole platform:Even at a more significant scale today, we maintain a focus on improving strong retention.For context on D30 retention, all of Snap, TikTok, Twitter, and Facebook have D30 new-user retention between 28% and 40% (source). Ours is currently in the mid-30s.It‚Äôs important to note that there are social products that have built single-player utility after they built a network, and others, like Facebook, that never had to.But many did. For example, Venmo didn‚Äôt start as a social payment network with a robust activity page; it had a clear utility-based user story that was deeply valuable to you: ‚Äúget paid by a friend.‚Äù Of course, over time, as the network formed, they developed a significant moat and a network effect that resulted in the story changing to ‚Äúget paid by your friends‚Äîall of them‚Äîeven faster.‚Äù There was a very clear utility-oriented use case along the entire journey‚Äîand one that helped them survive within friend groups, even if it didn‚Äôt work initially between them.Takeaway: Look for (and double down on) a single-player use case to increase retention (both short- and long-term) that will help unlock time to figure out multiplayer social features that create lasting network effects.2. Build a product that users feel was built just for themMost experiences on your phone feel remarkably impersonal. From day one, our approach helped make Saturn a refreshingly personal experience.We started by white-labeling an app for the students at Connecticut‚Äôs Weston High School. We spent a month working with our student ambassador there to deeply understand the complexities of her schedule and the challenges it resulted in for her and her friends. Then we built iWeston to perfectly support their calendar.The night we launched, more than half of the student body joined in just the first three hours.For our first 17 schools, we repeated this process of launching white-labeled apps, each with the school‚Äôs letter as its icon, making the app more recognizable and reducing friction to download on the App Store. Another benefit: it looked better on users‚Äô home screens.When you logged in to any of these apps, you were greeted with an experience that was colorized for your school and perfectly supported the complexities of your schedule. It felt like the app had been built just for your school, because it was.These school launches were really exciting. We‚Äôd recruit an ambassador and then work with them to understand the mechanics of their school, which took less time as we became more familiar with complex schedules. We‚Äôd then work with them to spread the word on ‚Äúlaunch night‚Äù and in the days that followed. They were consistently excited to launch at their schools, and frequently earned social capital for having been our ambassador. For the first few launches, growing at a school was as simple as orchestrating Facebook posts in school-related groups and texts in group chats to help make sure people knew the app was available. Over time, we honed this process, adding sharing links, developing custom landing pages, and adding dynamic content that could be shared directly to your social stories‚Äîall of this with the goal of making it easier to invite your friends to join you.By virtue of this product and growth strategy, we came to market with an experience that was unusually perfectly fit to the audience of a specific school. This translated into incredibly fast adoption at schools. It was common to win a critical mass at schools in hours:Launch performance from Darien High School and Ridgefield High School (both in Connecticut) upon launch in 2018, as reflected in our first pitch deck. These schools launched the same night. Within three hours of going live, we had almost 300 students sign up at Darien (~25% of the student body) and about 225 at Ridgefield (~15%).By the time we reached 18 schools, we were balancing the need to ship new features and bug fixes and also launch at new schools. We decided to finally consolidate into a single app: Saturn. By consolidating, we unlocked a significantly faster school launch rate while preserving the personal touches users were loving.We consolidated from a network of 18 apps to Saturn in March of 2019. Saturn is the Roman god of time.We wanted the experience of joining your school to be magical regardless of our scale. Even today, you arrive, add your classes, and everything is reflected perfectly. It leaves you with a ‚Äúhow did they do that?‚Äù feeling. The calendar is what feels the most familiar‚Äîit‚Äôs your daily schedule, after all. The app is still colorized for your school, and you‚Äôre greeted on arrival with your school mascot and friends‚Äô avatars. Delight always matters.Your in-app experience feels delightfully yours, no matter what school you go to.We chose to scale this personalized product approach, instead of changing the product to make it less personal. This now results in bespoke support for our nearly 20,000 schools.To be clear: we weren‚Äôt the first to do this. Facebook, for example, went to significant lengths to support their early schools well, which was fundamental to achieving significant depth in each. This got the network off the ground and eventually allowed them to expand to a broader product.There are two schools of thought around these kinds of bespoke models:Avoid silos at all cost, as they will naturally inhibit scale.Silos enable better product-market fit by solving for users who are very similar, and over time that will help you build a product that remains high-fit across the country.We are believers in the latter‚Äîalthough this approach requires patience and, if you‚Äôd like to scale nationally without compromise (as we did), a willingness to invest heavily in building unique tools and infrastructure and hiring more people. Some founders may not choose to do this or may not be able to raise the capital to support it. We didn‚Äôt really have a choice; our product was built around a utility that was complicated to develop and maintain. This forced us to build a larger, more experienced team, capable of handling the operational overhead that would come with growth.One note: When developing products for small audiences, be careful not to overspecialize for a specific area, community, type of user, etc. For us, this meant a school district, or geography. A good way to avoid this is to use an approach around opposites. If you‚Äôre launching urban schools, try suburban schools; if they are predominantly affluent schools, try schools with students from more mixed economic backgrounds, etc. Our first schools were all in southwestern Connecticut, a very affluent region by national standards. In order to ensure the product had fit with students from different backgrounds (and different types of schools), we next launched schools in more economically diverse parts of New Jersey, Massachusetts, etc.¬†This is especially important if you want to raise venture capital. Investors will always want to know the ‚Äúbounds‚Äù of users you have tested with: across age, income level, region, etc. The more types of users you‚Äôve proven your product can win over, the better.Takeaway: When users are in your app, they need to feel at home. Much like a personal gift from a friend, building a deeply personal user experience earns user trust and engagement. Always be thinking about the things, big and small, that can make users feel that magic.3. It‚Äôs OK to be unscalable‚Äîyou can make it scale laterFor us, this was not only relevant in the context of building custom apps for each school when we were getting started, but also building a team of local ambassadors to help us win over the students at each school.Using the calendar as the retentive ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù of the product presented a problem. We learned quickly that inaccurate calendars caused user churn, and it was very challenging to maintain accurate ones. Schools have unique schedules and are changing them constantly, for reasons as simple as the weather. A single storm system can cause chaos for millions of students, and our retention was only as good as our ability to maintain accurate data. Without it, users wouldn‚Äôt stick around.There was also no centralized source of data, which made this extremely difficult. To start, we sourced data on these changes from students on the ground, and also gave them responsibilities to help with growth.Many investors told us this ambassador program was fundamentally unscalable, and while we agreed that it added significant friction, the lessons we extracted from the program, the consistency of the early growth they provided, and the access to our users were so valuable that we grew the network to more than a thousand students anyway. Instead of discarding the program at a few dozen schools, we went deeper, refined it, and adapted our approach. And even when their growth responsibilities were eventually retired, we maintained a cohort from this passionate group and continue to leverage them as an invaluable resource for user research.Scaling our ambassador count to grow our user base wasn‚Äôt pretty, but it worked for years. We were able to iterate through the most challenging constraints of building the program and successfully use it as our default model to launch the majority of our first 1,000 schools.Our ambassadors were helping us in three ways:Providing us with the data, context, and information about a schedule necessary to launch a school on Saturn, including keeping us in the loop as schedules changedHelping to ‚Äúseed‚Äù schools (remember, we have a product that works well even if you‚Äôre alone, so the first few users are still really valuable)Spreading the word and establishing a larger initial cohort of users from which we could grow over timeEventually, we stopped trying to force scale through ambassadors and instead began to productize each of these responsibilities. It‚Äôs worth noting that some things can‚Äôt be productized, like the need for users who care enough about your product that they grow it organically through word of mouth.We began to source our data from users on a waitlist. When we launched our first one in July 2021, more than 100,000 students from 10,000 schools joined in 90 days. This gave us a backlog of the information needed to get more schools live.We turned to crowdsourcing to help maintain calendars, which was simple once the network hit sufficient scale. Instead of relying on ambassadors to keep a school‚Äôs schedule up to date, we could entrust our users with this responsibility and use consensus modeling to provide even more accurate data. In this respect, growth gave us optionality and allowed us to eliminate this dependency. The users‚Äô interest was aligned with ours‚Äîif they submitted data, they would have an accurate calendar for themselves. It was a reasonable ask. In our case, overcoming this data challenge wasn‚Äôt optional; it was a prerequisite to creating a retentive platform.With more data on school performance over time, we began to see a very clear trend that schools were growing significantly year over year. This validated our hypothesis that once a school was ‚Äúseeded,‚Äù we could invest in it for the long term and it would eventually become fully saturated. If we could get a school live, it didn‚Äôt really matter how we got the first few installs, and it was infeasible to launch tens of thousands of schools with a hand-picked student at each one. Once the schools were live at scale, it unlocked new (less targeted) strategies for the top of our funnel, like performance acquisition.Scaling this program resulted in a deep familiarity with the operational challenges we‚Äôd have to overcome and an understanding of growth at the school level‚Äîincluding how to reach and acquire users at a specific school and how to catalyze the growth flywheel consistently, both of which were critical for us to achieve national scale. In short, this most unscalable part of our business provided the insights and lessons we‚Äôve leveraged since to hit a point where our social product could begin to drive real user value.Takeaway: An advisor once told us, ‚ÄúStartups exist to do things other companies wouldn‚Äôt do‚Äîor can‚Äôt do.‚Äù Be scrappy and have a high tolerance for ‚Äúpain‚Äù at the beginning. It will often unlock key lessons you‚Äôll need to scale.4.

What is good free-to-paid conversion

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeQ: What is considered a good free-to-paid conversion rate?Getting this benchmarking data is difficult because very few companies publish their conversion rates, and metrics can look wildly different depending on the target customer, product experience, and sales motion. At the same time, improving your free-to-paid conversion rate is one of the single best ways to increase revenue without adding headcount or marketing spend.To get you a definitive answer, I partnered with Kyle Poyar from OpenView Ventures and the excellent Growth Unhinged newsletter, and the wonderful team at Pendo, to run the most in-depth product benchmarking survey ever. We collected data from 1,000+ products, and from that pulled out a host of fascinating takeaways, including:Good and great conversion rate by product typeThe most effective ways to increase your free-to-paid conversionThe differences between freemium vs. trial productsPricing and packaging tipsMuch moreYou can check out the full report here. The data set focused on B2B SaaS, but we ended up with data for prosumers/micro-SMBs all the way up to large enterprises. We tried to look at conversion from every possible angle, but if we missed something, drop a comment and we‚Äôll update the post with additional learnings.1. What exactly is ‚Äúfree-to-paid conversion‚Äù?Your free-to-paid conversion is the percentage of new accounts who end up paying for the product in the first 6 months.Free-to-paid conversion = [new accounts who begin paying within their first 6 months] / [total new accounts created during the measurement window]The best practice is to measure free-to-paid conversion on a cohort basis, looking at the percentage of new accounts who begin paying within their first X number of months. Without looking at conversion on a cohort basis, it‚Äôs impossible to tell whether you‚Äôre getting sequentially better or just pulling forward conversion that would naturally happen over time. Our data assumes a six-month conversion window.An account could be made up of a single user or a collection of users. We‚Äôve defined the data at an account level. Of course, the lifetime value of the two audiences might differ significantly. Make sure to monitor conversion rates across different audiences and not only the blended rate.2. What is a good and great free-to-paid conversion rate?On average, 3%-5% is a GOOD conversion rate for a freemium self-serve product, and 6%-8% is GREAT. This group includes products like Canva, Trello, and Typeform.For a freemium product with a sales-assist motion, 5%-7% is a GOOD conversion and 10%-15% is GREAT. Examples of freemium products with a sales-assist motion include Airtable, GitLab, and HubSpot‚Äîany products where sales is generally involved in closing new customers.Products that offer a free trial (i.e. you can use all of the features for a set amount of time, like Shopify, Google Workspace, and Intercom) have higher conversion rates on average‚ÄîGOOD is 8%-12% conversion, and 15%-25% is GREAT.¬†My theory for why free trial products are so much higher is that these products are typically attracting a user that‚Äôs more ready to buy, which then makes them more innately ripe for sales involvement. Sign-up rates for free-trial products are materially lower than for freemium products (5% vs. 9%, respectively). There‚Äôs time pressure in a free trial‚Äîsince users can access it for only a short period of time‚Äîand so people wait to sign up until they‚Äôre serious. As a result, it‚Äôs common for free-trial products to have sales involved in most or all cases. Nearly half of free-trial companies (44%) have sales reach out directly to more than half of sign-ups, double the rate of freemium SaaS (24%).3. What is a good free-to-paid conversion for my specific type of product?The numbers above are useful, but they don‚Äôt tell the full story. Free-to-paid conversion rates vary substantially from company to company and by product type. It‚Äôs not uncommon for one freemium business to see free-to-paid conversion rates below 1%, while another is able to get to closer to 20%.Here‚Äôs what we saw in the data for freemium products:A fifth (20%) of products see a free-to-paid conversion rate below 2.5%About a third (33%) see between 2.5% and 5%‚Äîand this is the biggest bucketOnly about 15% see a conversation rate higher than 20% (not pictured).For free-trial products:Only 7% of free-trial products see a free-to-paid conversion rate below 2.5%A quarter (~24%) of products see a conversion rate between 7.5% and 10%‚Äîthe most common bucket14% of products see a free-to-paid conversion rate as high as 20%Looking at the data by customer type is also illuminating. A few takeaways:If you‚Äôre selling to larger customers, plan for lower free-to-paid conversion. Bigger companies tend to have more stakeholders involved in the buying process and more complex requirements. (There‚Äôs also the potential for bigger deal sizes, compensating for the lower conversion rates.)¬†It‚Äôs a truism that developers are a tough crowd to sell to‚Äîand the data supports that intuition. The median conversion rate for developer-focused companies was 5%; this was half that of companies that do not sell to developers.We investigated conversion rates based on a long list of other factors, too. The data did not indicate statistically significant differences based on the revenue of the company, year-over-year growth rate, or whether the product was a horizontal app or vertical-specific app.4. How do I increase my free-to-paid conversion?Regardless of how your product stacks up, you‚Äôre probably thinking the same thing: what should I do to increase conversion? We observed four specific behaviors that can move the needle on free-to-paid conversion.This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

The unconventional Palantir principles that catalyzed a generation of startups

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeNext in my special paternity-leave guest series, I‚Äôm excited to bring you an incredible post by Adam Judelson. Adam spent seven years at Palantir, where he led product for their flagship Gotham data platform. Below, Adam shares his most lasting lessons from his time at Palantir.After Palantir, Adam went on to lead product at¬†Slingshot Aerospace, built a startup for Deloitte, and then served as president at¬†mePrism, where he grew their data privacy marketplace from zero to 100 million data points protected. Adam is also a two-time founder and advisor to businesses ranging from scrappy drone startups to space and satellite companies to large private-equity-backed firms. These days, he runs First Principles, a product agency focused on helping companies achieve their world-changing visions. You can find Adam on¬†LinkedIn and¬†Twitter, and definitely check out his¬†Product Principles newsletter, where he shares lessons from the best emerging tech product leaders.The CTO of Palantir Technologies, Shyam Sankar, in April 2023 testified before the U.S. Senate that ‚Äúwe must spend at least 5% of our [defense] budget on capabilities that will terrify our adversaries.‚Äù Shyam and CEO Alex Karp‚Äôs unwavering commitment to strengthening our country motivated me to resign from the civil service and permanently defer attending a top law school so I could join what was then Palantir‚Äôs small band of engineering mavericks. Our mission was simple: revolutionize the way the world‚Äôs largest and most important organizations answer their hardest questions. Fast-forward a decade, and Palantir is a public company whose alumni have gone on to build nine unicorns, from Anduril to Handshake to Amplitude, and over 100 additional venture-backed companies.1¬†¬†At Palantir, we didn‚Äôt believe in heavy processes, because we felt that formulas and playbooks tacitly give people permission to stop thinking for themselves. Nonetheless, as I reflect on the experiences we had together and as I now partner with new startups looking to learn from Palantir‚Äôs experience, I feel compelled to compile and share my unofficial list of learnings.2 While the company has at times been a lightning rod for public speculation, the secrecy and misinformation surrounding its missions often prevent the amazing product lessons it forged from spreading the way they deserve. Not every lesson will work for every startup or innovation team, but I hope these ideas will catalyze others to consider unconventional approaches to doing the impossible and encourage the creation of more world-changing technologies.A playbook of first principles: To disrupt an industry. . .1. Forward-deploy your engineeringProduct thought leaders tend to extol the value of talking to users, but most are barely scratching the surface. At Palantir, one of the largest teams was called Forward Deployed Engineering.3 This is the team I joined when I first got hired, and we were responsible for making our early product live up to the vision. Our main goal was creating product solutions for issues blocking customer adoption, or that could unlock new growth. The golden nugget in this philosophy is that you don‚Äôt worry about how to ask users the right questions or obsess over ‚Äúinterviewing‚Äù them. Instead, you are literally there, in the shit with them, getting involved in what is happening. In the early days at Palantir, this meant flying to war zones carrying a bunch of laptops to where U.S. forces actually engaged the enemy. In a commercial context, it didn‚Äôt mean jumping on the phone with the fraud specialists at a major bank. It meant going and spending the next three months in customer operations centers, working the same leads as the customer. Anduril, where many Palantir alumni have gone next, continues a similar practice, and I‚Äôve met numerous excellent PMs who work this way even when it‚Äôs not a part of the company culture.4Palantir servers arrive on the tarmac in Afghanistan circa 2009It‚Äôs not just getting downrange that matters. You have to be the user to unlock this concept. I don‚Äôt mean that spiritually as in ‚Äúthink like the user‚Äù; I mean literally do their same job with your product as an extended member of their team and see what you learn. You don‚Äôt embed for 20 minutes, either. A lot of the real aha moments come after you‚Äôve been in the customer‚Äôs shoes for an extended period of time. Work with your product long enough that the customer is impressed that you‚Äôve accomplished something real for their business that they couldn‚Äôt. In the early days of one of our most successful engagements that led to an over $100 million deal, the customer had no users of our product for the first 6 to 12 months. We formed a small team that was given direct access, integrated their data into our existing product, built prototype solutions for the unique problems this engagement taught us about, and then performed the analysis and briefed it directly to a top worldwide CEO.Forward-deployed engineer Mark Scianna doing ‚Äúuser interviews‚ÄùSome financial market analysts have judged Palantir harshly for this sort of embedded dedication, attempting to cast the company as a services organization or consultancy. They completely miss the point that this process is how to learn which problems matter the most and how to build compelling solutions; it is not a permanent state but rather a tool for the vanguard as it approaches a new use case. Further, when innovating in emerging technology applications, often the customer doesn‚Äôt yet have a conceptualization of how they will work in the future, so by being one of them, you can establish the first patterns for doing that work excellently. Instead of spending years iterating based on a loose understanding of the customer, we completely understood what mattered and executed immediately, driving real value an order of magnitude faster with superior results.¬†¬†Lessons:Go fully inside the customer‚Äôs environment.Don‚Äôt just empathize with the user; be the user.Do real customer work long enough to have full empathy and inspire.A Palantir engineer‚Äôs analysis in 2011 of the succession of Southern Sudan2. Hire the best absolute greatest people who existEveryone says ‚Äútalent is everything‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs all about the people,‚Äù but many executives who I‚Äôve encountered have never worked with the absolute best on the planet. As a result, it‚Äôs not obvious to them when they have hired someone who is decent, pretty good, or even downright average. Just because someone saves your butt doesn‚Äôt mean they are ‚Äúamazing‚Äù or a ‚Äúrock star.‚Äù Sure, we say that and are appreciative, but that‚Äôs not what we mean. We aren‚Äôt talking about ‚Äúthe top 1%.‚Äù We are talking about the literal one best person for the job who exists on Planet Earth. I cannot stress this difference enough. FAANG companies are the backup plan for this cohort.Early in our days engaging with military customers at Palantir, we hired directly from special forces, for example ex-Navy SEALs. The SEALs are the cr√©me de la cr√©me in a military context, but we didn‚Äôt stop there. We hired some of the most decorated and well-known Navy SEAL commanders alive today. I distinctly recall telling customers who I was bringing to the meetings, and people who had never met either of us would instantly know that individual‚Äôs reputation and nickname, and what he was known for. Last year, a space and AI startup I was advising set a great example for this lesson. They wanted to build a first-of-its-kind satellite fabrication facility. The person they hired for the job is an engineer who has built more satellites that are in the sky today than any other human. That‚Äôs hiring the absolute best.Hiring this way is crucial for two reasons. First, the best are, well, better, at the specific work they‚Äôve been asked to tackle. But the less-understood reason why this is so high-leverage is because the world opens doors for people at the very top of their respective fields. The best AI engineers in the world, for example, attract media attention, top VC attention, and top founder attention. As a result, they are better connected and have disproportionately more access to the other best people in the world. This accelerates their learning and dramatically improves their ability to make the impossible happen. The difference between the #1 and the #50 in the world in terms of skills is practically indistinguishable, but as a result of being #1, that individual likely has access to an order of magnitude more knowledge, opportunity, and talent. This problem cascades down the organization through hiring generations, which is one of the reasons why the best startups are orders of magnitude better than the next tier down.Prof. Lambeau: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, Will. I can‚Äôt do this proof. But you can, and when it comes to that, it‚Äôs only about. . . it‚Äôs just a handful of people in the world who can tell the difference between you and me. But I‚Äôm one of them.‚Äù¬†‚ÄîGood Will Hunting, 1997But the top people aren‚Äôt always obvious or famous, so that cannot be our only means for identifying them. One of my favorite new startups is Quindar Space. The Quindar team is easily one of the best teams in the world for the problem they are solving. They focus on every piece of software technology required for satellite spaceflight that is not directly a part of the satellite‚Äîfor example, software for determining when to maneuver, tracking onboard issues, and finding ground stations on Earth that satellites can beam data down to. The founders all built this type of software together at multiple prolific satellite companies, including OneWeb (the company with the second-most satellites in orbit after SpaceX), before they became founders at Quindar. Almost no one has more experience or skill in standing up these systems, giving them an enormous advantage. Sometimes these individuals are well known and other times they have been buried in a bureaucracy, and sometimes they don‚Äôt even know that they are the world‚Äôs best at a particular problem.Lessons:For each discipline on the critical path to success, hire the world‚Äôs #1.To be sure, ask others in the community if those people are the best.Look in unexpected places for the talent‚Äîit‚Äôs the experience, not the fame.3. Hire no salespeople‚Äîinstead have engineers do salesAt Palantir we broke most business rules. Not for the sake of it, but because we valued thinking from first principles, or the art of getting to the core of what is true multiple layers beneath the surface of the problem. For example, one of our most controversial early decisions was to put people like me and engineers in front of customers, instead of a formal sales team.5 Why exactly is a salesperson necessary to sell a product? Is that the best way to handle the situation? Sometimes it is, but for a complex mission-driven sale, we realized that we could disrupt the old model in a positive way. Instead of forcing our government customers into opportunistic pitches from professional relationship brokers, we could put former operators and engineers in the room instead. As a result, we could speak intelligently about the mission and our product from firsthand experience. We didn‚Äôt try to hide the skeletons or answer questions ‚Äúthe right way.‚Äù Rather, we spoke to our clients like normal people would. Without formal sales training, we were forced to find ways to create value in sales settings and not waste time. Put in the extreme, if what you are building is incredibly compelling, and if someone truly wants to buy it, then the customer doesn‚Äôt require a person with a sales background to ask closing questions to scope the engagement and deliver the product.Author in front of a periodic table, one element per major Palantir software releaseI was shocked when, fresh out of working in government, I was told to take point on all inbound sales inquiries through the Palantir website while simultaneously taking responsibility for some of our earliest customer engagements. The demanding customer implementation schedule meant that time spent ‚Äúdoing sales‚Äù was time I couldn‚Äôt spend working on the missions that compelled me to join Palantir in the first place. Potential customers and partners didn‚Äôt get true attention from me unless I personally believed that we could help them achieve something meaningful for the mission. Instead of golf, steak dinners, and boxes at sporting events (which aren‚Äôt allowed in government contracting anyway), I would ask questions to partners like, ‚ÄúHow will you make your money on this?‚Äù and to prospects, ‚ÄúHow fast can you get us integrated into your mission so we can have an impact?‚Äù It‚Äôs exceedingly difficult to get that sort of authentic motivation and customer connection out of traditional sales teams that are incentivized by commissions and who come from backgrounds in sales rather than the work itself.¬†Lessons:Evaluate who the customer needs to hear from to believe, and put those people in the right places at the right times.Delay hiring professional salespeople for as long as possible.4. Experimenting with live productsI‚Äôm going to make just about every single well-trained product person grumble here. For anyone who learned product formally, you learned to experiment cheaply, meaning not with expensive engineering time and code. We‚Äôre supposed to use designs, value tests, landing pages, and all sorts of other lightweight methods to measure the value of a product before we build it. Well, at Palantir, we often used working products as the iterative units of value. When we learned about new customer needs, we didn‚Äôt spend a lot of time standing back and designing product experiments or running extensive discovery sprints. We designed and built instead. Then we shared with customers. Then we‚Äôd subtract and add and build again, and then we‚Äôd share again, and so forth. We did full-scale product iteration with real working code. To supercharge velocity, we sent our designers forward too, and generally worked in daily cycles.Doubling down on value on each iterative passI won‚Äôt belabor the disadvantages of this style, as they are pretty obvious (wasting lots of time and money on code no one uses), but the advantages when it works are so powerful as to be nearly unfair. For starters, to customers it is magical to see their feedback incorporated into the product nearly instantaneously. This creates insanely strong advocates. Perhaps more importantly, though, it takes the guesswork out of trying to understand if users will care. If they don‚Äôt care, they won‚Äôt use the product, and you‚Äôll know that immediately. That‚Äôs a clear signal to go back to the drawing board. If they do care, they will use the new features and create tons of value with them in less time than it takes typical product teams to review feedback, much less build something. There is also nothing lost in translating their desire into a product‚Äîyou can be entirely clear with them about how you are solving their problem, and they can be entirely clear on what they are getting. This creates a huge amount of trust and avoids the mental gymnastics sometimes required to test difficult assumptions, especially with hard-to-reach users.This is not something that only Palantir can do; however, it is something that only teams with very strong engineers can do. Teams without engineers who can make serious, meaningful improvements to products in less than 24 hours should skip this strategy and focus on delivering validated product solutions as quickly as they can using traditional discovery and validation techniques. Effectively, what we did that was novel was to use skill and experience to make writing code cheaper than typical teams can run most experiments. Particularly in the earlier days, when running frequent experiments in secure facilities would have been extremely difficult because of how few users we could access in these rarified environments, this worked great.Lessons:Consider using working products to iterate with users instead of designs and concepts.Acknowledge that most of what you show won‚Äôt have value, but what value is there will grow rapidly if you focus.Honestly assess who in your company has the skill to participate in this model, and do not impose it on everyone.Keep using traditional discovery and validation techniques for high-risk endeavors, but consider blending working prototypes more frequently in the mix.5. Build features that magnify value over timeWe want to solve customer problems, but we also want to solve them in ways whereby the next user or customer is better off because of what the first user did. This can manifest as (1) a growing data asset, for example more valuable records or an increasingly well-trained machine learning model, or (2) network effects from user and customer interactions with one another. At Palantir, we focused on both. One key value proposition in our Gotham platform was its ability to find unknown connections across large data sets, for example between a terrorist financier and a bomb builder. Finding and disrupting a connection like this can save lives. The system already integrated key data sources, but before AI could ‚Äúread‚Äù well, computers were horrible at identifying these sorts of connections in textual reports written about suspects. One of our stickiest features addressed this challenge: we called it ‚Äútagging.‚Äù If you read a document that said that John Smith was a terrorist suspect using the telephone number ‚Äú123-456-7890,‚Äù you could select that text and effectively write it back to the system as a new structured entity. This information, part of the growing data asset, would then link to the other existing structured records. The next user would find evidence of John Smith, see the source referencing him as a suspect, and then easily surface connections through that telephone number, without having to first read the report. If the system previously had a billion records that made it compelling to users, it now had a billion and one, plus possibly dozens of new, unexplored connections. Further, users could leave their own analytic remarks after pouring hours into an investigation, helping the next user start from the last user‚Äôs end point. Now imagine one organization with thousands of users each tagging and commenting thousands of times per year. As each user contributes more to the data asset and interacts within the network of each other‚Äôs content, the entire product‚Äôs value grows at a rate higher than the linear growth in users because more value exists than in the previous generation.Peregrine, another Palantir-alumni-founded company, nails this same concept. They focus on helping public safety organizations collaborate on real-time information. One of their compounding value features is the ability for different public safety organizations to form software-defined sharing arrangements, where authorized records can be shared without requiring someone to pick up the phone first. Agencies can share a living report with organizations that have the right to access the data but who aren‚Äôt customers, and through this pathway, the new agency can see an easy pathway to joining the collective. When they do, the sharing becomes even more compelling for the original members, increasing product stickiness for all.¬†To build features like these, you don‚Äôt need to solve different problems than your product is already solving‚Äîyou simply need to put more thought into how to solve them in ways that draw in or add value for others. Repl.it does a great job here too, in that each new public template coding project can act as a starter project for a new or existing user to build upon, drawing in people who might not have gotten started if they had to begin with a blank screen.Lessons:Identify ways to solve problems in the product that increase value over time for the nth user.Supercharge those cycles by streamlining usability, and call attention to them with new users.6.

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeP.S. Don‚Äôt miss Lennybot ‚ú® (an AI chatbot trained on my newsletter posts, podcast interviews, and more) and my new swag store (great gifts for your favorite PM, or yourself!).I was speaking with one of my favorite B2B founders and asked her what company she‚Äôd most love to learn from. Her immediate answer: ‚ÄúGong! I want to know everything about that company.‚ÄùGong is one of the fastest SaaS companies in history to reach $100 million in ARR, has over 4,000 customers‚Äîincluding companies like Snowflake, Shopify, HubSpot, and LinkedIn‚Äîand has raised more than $500 million from Tier 1 investors like Sequoia Capital, Coatue, and Thrive Capital.To get an inside look at how Gong builds product, I sat down with Eilon Reshef, the co-founder and chief product officer. Here‚Äôs what stood out to me most about Gong‚Äôs approach to product:The incredibly high amount of autonomy teams haveTeams being organized around outcomes (aka ‚Äúproblem areas‚Äù), not featuresThe ‚ÄúW‚Äù-framework yearly planning process, the quarterly ‚ÄúM‚Äù processTheir dislike for OKRs and ScrumEngineers, not PMs, owning prioritization of bugsHow closely teams work with design partners when developing new product lines, and their ‚Äúslice‚Äù strategy for new productsThe almost-real-life assignment principle for interviewingTo learn more about Gong, check out their website, demo page, and new AI platform.For more stories of how the best product teams operate, don‚Äôt miss my deep dives into Linear, Shopify, Figma, Notion, Duolingo, Ramp, Miro, Coda, and Snowflake.How Gong builds productEilon Reshef, co-founder and CPO1. How far out do you plan in detail, and how has that evolved over the years?We have two main planning cycles: annual and quarterly.¬†The annual process works along a ‚ÄúW‚Äù shape, similar to the framework Lenny suggested here.It starts at the top, with the Gong management team setting up top company priorities‚Äîusually three or four. Based on these priorities, product and engineering determine the capacity for the different products and product areas. So for example, if we‚Äôve decided to enter a new category, we will assign several pods that would be focused on this new category. When we decided to build our sales engagement product, for example, we reallocated some existing pods toward that goal.Initially, a straw-man plan is built (bottom-up), with the ‚Äúbig rocks‚Äù that are planned for the year. It is presented to the leadership team for high-level feedback. Then a more detailed plan is put together. That plan includes more specific feature descriptions and more concrete timelines.The output of this process is guidance for the plan one year ahead, at a decreasing level of certainty: good certainty for the upcoming quarter, lower certainty the following quarter, and a very rough sketch of the second half.¬†Once the plan is prepared, it is communicated broadly throughout the company. We found out that it‚Äôs helpful to have a single person on the product team (within the product operations team) assigned to handle the collection and communication of these plans.Of course, we also involve teams other than management in the process. Over time, we‚Äôve built various workshops with different teams (e.g. sales, customer success) to reduce the chances of having blind spots. For example, as part of our 2024 planning, we ran a workshop with the revenue leadership team, which brought up certain opportunities for addressing the needs of revenue leaders within our customer base; not all those needs were identified within the planning process.Each quarter, we run a trimmed-down version of this process. Oftentimes, there isn‚Äôt new top-down guidance, so the process looks more like an ‚ÄúM,‚Äù starting from the product pods. We then create a pretty substantial document‚Äînorth of 20 pages‚Äîthat details the plan and what is expected to be built during the upcoming quarter.Here‚Äôs the first page of our FY2024 Q3 plan (8-10/2023):We also provide an abridged version of the high-level rocks, for executive consumption:Also during this process, we provide (relatively light) updates to the annual plan. In principle, we aim to provide a rolling 12-month window of the plan, with a decreasing level of clarity.We do not plan monthly or biweekly. Both the engineering leader and I dislike the Scrum methodology. We feel it‚Äôs trying to drive urgency via artificial deadlines versus via value to the customer. And by forcing ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù to deliverables within a time window, it essentially inhibits on-the-fly trade-offs between content, quality, and timelines. Yet we have internal reviews with the different groups on a monthly basis.What‚Äôs interesting is that the process hasn‚Äôt changed materially over the years. That is, we had annual and quarterly planning almost from day one. But the process has become more structured over time: distribution across teams, deeper documentation and information dissemination, and so on.2. How do you structure your product teams? Has this changed over the years?When we started Gong, I built what we now call a pod: a product manager (which was initially me), a product designer, and a handful of engineers (front-end, back-end, and generalists).Later on, as we started to scale, we debated how to structure the pods. In my prior life, I‚Äôve seen org structures built around engineering specialization (back-end vs. front-end or platform vs. applications). Even back in 2017, we realized that we wanted to optimize for customer-centricity and velocity instead of optimizing for specialization.So we‚Äôve continued to build autonomous multi-skill teams (pods) around product areas‚Äîwhat is now known as ‚Äúempowered product teams.‚Äù¬†Each pod is focused on a problem area (for example, ‚Äúsales forecasting‚Äù), which roughly aligns with a set of ‚Äújobs‚Äù that are carried out either by a given persona (e.g. a sales coach) or by multiple people doing a business process (e.g. a pipeline review).Now that we‚Äôre bigger, pods are assembled into ‚Äúgroups,‚Äù and each group roughly aligns with a product. For better or worse, products are usually aligned with an industry definition of a category (e.g. ‚Äúconversation intelligence‚Äù or ‚Äúsales engagement‚Äù). And in most cases, those products span multiple user types across a set of strongly connected workflows. For example, our ‚ÄúEngage‚Äù product is a sales engagement product, which serves account executives (working with new or existing customers), sales development managers (prospecting to new accounts), managers (driving the teams), and revenue operations (who set up the playbooks).The structure is along the lines below:While this works in theory, we do have exceptions.Most notably, we have a data platform group, which is responsible for all data capture, data export, and data integrations. These tend to span multiple products, and we found out that it makes more sense to centralize those.Another cross-functional group is a user journey group, which also spans all products and drives the user journey (home page, targeting, recommendations, and so on). That team also drives the (naturally cross-functional) mobile application.The product group nowadays also includes non-‚Äúbuild‚Äù functions. I have leaders who drive new products‚Äô go-to-market, field product management, product partnerships, and, most recently, product marketing.3. How do your product/design review meetings work?¬†We are relatively extreme in letting the teams autonomously drive their own agendas. That is, once a pod has been assigned an area of responsibility, a great outcome is that they come up with the respective product design. So the leadership team is hardly involved in the detailed design or the iterations with customers along the way.This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

Simplify security.‚Ä¢ LinkedIn Ads‚ÄîReach professionals and drive results for your business‚ÄîJason Lemkin created and runs SaaStr, the world‚Äôs largest community for B2B/SaaS founders, and is the managing director of SaaStr Fund, a $90 million venture capital firm specializing in early-stage enterprise investments. He is also the mastermind behind two major tech conferences each year‚Äîone in the Bay Area, drawing in over 15,000 people, and another in Europe, with a crowd of more than 3,000 SaaS executives, founders, and entrepreneurs. Before SaaStr, Jason wore many hats: CEO and co-founder of EchoSign (later bought by Adobe), vice president at Adobe Systems, co-founder and president of NanoGram Devices Corp., vice president of NeoPhotonics, and a senior director at BabyCenter. In our conversation, we discuss:‚Ä¢ How far you should go without a salesperson‚Ä¢ Signs it‚Äôs time to hire salespeople‚Ä¢ Why you need to hire two salespeople‚Ä¢ How to compensate your salespeople‚Ä¢ How to interview salespeople‚Ä¢ When to hire a VP of Sales‚Ä¢ How to prevent their flaming out‚Ä¢ How to scale your sales org‚Ä¢ How to improve the relationship between your sales and product teams‚Ä¢ Much moreSome takeaways:Hire your first salesperson when you have closed the first 10 customers and are spending more than 20% of your time on sales. Don‚Äôt be swayed solely by impressive resumes or acronyms; instead, seek out those individuals who you would personally buy your product from.Instead of rushing to hire a VP early in the startup phase, wait until you have established a repeatable sales process and witnessed success with initial sales reps hitting quota. Hire a VP of Sales to help you scale from three sales reps to 300 reps.Make sure your VP of Sales actually wants to sell, not just manage.Prioritize the early success of sales reps by allowing them to keep 100% of their initial sales for the first three months. This provides an opportunity to assess their capabilities without immediate financial pressure.If your salespeople are making substantial money, it‚Äôs a sign that the company is succeeding and the equity of both the reps and the founders is increasing in value. Therefore, don‚Äôt be discouraged if your sales team members are making significant earnings, as it correlates with the overall success and growth of the business.Involve sales in product development to ensure alignment between customer needs and product roadmap. Initiate a weekly meeting between the VP of Sales and the VP of Product to discuss the budget allocation for feature requests and prioritize it. This regular interaction ensures that both teams are aligned on priorities and helps prevent last-minute disruptions.Unlike building a product team, there is no efficiency when building a sales org: half of your headcount will be in sales at $10m, $50m, or $100m in revenue. This means building a sales org requires a different approach. Jason recommends that founders follow the ‚Äúrule of eights‚Äù when scaling their sales org: 8 sales reps need a manager, 8 account or sales executives need a director, and a VP may have 8 senior reports.A common mistake founders make is expecting to close the deal in the first or second meeting. Instead, you should play the long game. Ensure that there are clear next steps after every meeting, even if it‚Äôs doing a demo for someone else in the company. The best salespeople don‚Äôt throw a Hail Mary‚Äîthey advance the ball into the red zone. Once you‚Äôre in the red zone, that‚Äôs when you ask for money and close the deal.Listen now on Apple, Spotify, Overcast, and YouTube.Find the full transcript at: https://www.lennyspodcast.com/building-a-world-class-sales-org-jason-lemkin-saastr/Where to find Jason Lemkin:‚Ä¢ X: https://twitter.com/jasonlk‚Ä¢ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonmlemkin/‚Ä¢ Website: https://www.saastr.com/Where to find Lenny:‚Ä¢ Newsletter: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com‚Ä¢ X: https://twitter.com/lennysan‚Ä¢ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennyrachitsky/In this episode, we cover:(00:00) Jason‚Äôs background (06:18) The importance of sales in B2B businesses (11:23) Signs that you should start hiring salespeople (14:19) Attributes to look for in early sales reps (19:08) Hiring a VP of Sales (26:43) The role of a VP of Sales (30:06) Interviewing salespeople (45:16) Determining sales compensation and quota (53:34) Transitioning from 100% commission to a smaller percentage (56:58) Indicators of a hard-to-sell product (59:39) Scaling the sales organization (01:05:26) Understanding sales roles and titles (01:10:02) Product involvement in sales, and vice versa (01:20:32) Thoughts on product teams taking on P&L responsibilities (01:27:23) One thing founders can do to become better at sales (01:31:02) The ideal trial length for a free trial sales team (01:39:50) Closing thoughts (01:41:43) Lightning roundReferenced:‚Ä¢ Marc Benioff on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcbenioff/‚Ä¢ Snowflake: https://www.snowflake.com/en/‚Ä¢ Yamini Rangan on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaminirangan/‚Ä¢ Salesforce: https://www.salesforce.com/‚Ä¢ HubSpot: https://www.hubspot.com/‚Ä¢ Twilio: https://www.twilio.com/‚Ä¢ Cloudflare: https://www.cloudflare.com/‚Ä¢ GitHub: https://github.com/‚Ä¢ Columbo: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1466074/‚Ä¢ What is Davos and why is it important?

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeP.S. Don‚Äôt miss Lennybot‚Äîmy AI chatbot that‚Äôs trained on every newsletter post and podcast interview. It‚Äôs very good.Q: When do companies typically hire their first product manager?I reached out to 30 companies to find this out, and here you go:Takeaways:Everyone hires a product manager eventually.The typical company waited two to three years to hire their first product manager. They typically had 10 to 15 engineers and 15 to 25 total employees. But the ranges are wide, so don‚Äôt use this as a hard-and-fast rule.Surprisingly, more than half of companies hired their first PM before finding product-market fit, which is counter to the advice you hear. Particularly in B2B.No founder told me they regretted bringing on a PM, but some companies, including Notion, shared that they regretted waiting so long. Though others, like Stripe, were happy they wanted so long.Most first PMs were previously individual-contributor product managers, or senior PMs. Very few were previously former directors, VPs, or heads of product. Surprisingly, almost a fourth were engineers.Interestingly, many companies with a strong product founder hired a PM very early. Coda and Snyk (who both had PM founders) hired their PM essentially as their first employee, and Slack (with Stewart Butterfield) just over a year in.In terms of timing, there‚Äôs no one way to do it. Companies that hired a PM early did great (e.g. Snyk, Ramp, Slack), and companies that waited a long time (e.g. Stripe, Figma, Notion) did great.Companies that waited a long time to hire their PM had different reasons to wait:Notion spent much of that time (about three years) looking for product-market fit.Stripe was building an engineering-oriented product and hired top-tier product-minded engineers, so they didn‚Äôt have a strong need for PMs.Snap hired designers who took on the PM duties, which, from what I hear, ended up being fairly chaotic. They eventually hired a PM to lead their initial monetization efforts.Companies that hired a PM early, like Ramp and Snyk, did so because they didn‚Äôt have the skills or time to do the product job well, and they knew their product would make or break the business. More on this below.No matter how long you wait, whether you have a PM or not, someone will be doing the PM duties.If you‚Äôre looking to push out your first PM hire, the questions you need to ask yourself are:This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

How to successfully launch on Product Hunt (when it‚Äôs right for your startup)

























Lenny's NewsletterSubscribeSign inShare this postHow to successfully launch on Product Hunt (when it‚Äôs right for your startup)www.lennysnewsletter.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOtherHow to successfully launch on Product Hunt (when it‚Äôs right for your startup)Seven tips and five mythsLeo BosuenerMar 05, 2024‚àô Paid89Share this postHow to successfully launch on Product Hunt (when it‚Äôs right for your startup)www.lennysnewsletter.comCopy linkFacebookEmailNoteOther3Shareüëã Hey, I‚Äôm Lenny and welcome to a¬†üîí subscriber-only edition üîí¬†of my weekly newsletter. Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career.SubscribeP.S. Don‚Äôt miss Lennybot (an AI chatbot trained on my newsletter posts, podcast interviews, and more), my PM recruiting service (helping you hire Sr. PMs and VPs), my swag store (great gifts for your favorite PM, or yourself!), and The Best of Lenny‚Äôs Newsletter book (all proceeds going to charity).Q: How do I hit #1 on Product Hunt?Product Hunt is one of the most effective ways to get early users for a product. It‚Äôs free, available to everyone, and if you can pull off a great launch, Product Hunt can change your startup‚Äôs growth trajectory. Companies like Notion, Loom, Zapier, Robinhood, and Front all found their first set of users this way. However, the little-known truth is that of the thousands of startup founders who try their hand at Product Hunt each week, very few see any impact. For many, it proves to be a big waste of time.Over the past few months, I‚Äôve been polling startups that have done well on PH about their secret to winning. One name kept coming up: Leo Bosuener. Leo stays relatively under the radar (he doesn‚Äôt have a LinkedIn or Twitter profile), but his company Social Growth Labs has helped more than 60 startups hit #1 on Product Hunt, and over 100 startups hit the top 3. I didn‚Äôt know this initially, but he‚Äôs helped five of my portfolio companies alone (including Arcade, Daydream, and Mage) hit #1.I asked Leo if he‚Äôd be up for sharing his best advice, and I‚Äôm so happy he agreed. Below, Leo shares the seven things you need to get right to win on Product Hunt, and five myths. This is the most actionable and high-signal-to-noise guide for successfully launching on Product Hunt you‚Äôll find. I know many guides exist, but until this post, I‚Äôve never had one definitive guide to share with people that doesn‚Äôt also overwhelm them.I ran this guide by Rajiv Ayyangar (CEO of Product Hunt), asking him what‚Äôs missing or wrong about this advice, and his response was, ‚ÄúThis is honestly really great.‚Äù Rajiv went further and shared a few bonus pro tips that we‚Äôve integrated throughout the post.A huge thank-you to Leo for sharing his hard-earned wisdom. If you want to chat with Leo about your launch, learn more about his service here, and grab a time to chat with him here. When working with Leo‚Äôs team, the launch preparations will take on average around 10 hours, versus 50 to 120 hours when managing the campaign entirely in-house.It‚Äôs tempting to see Product Hunt as the golden ticket to startup fame. Many founders we talk to expect a PH launch to cause their servers to buckle under a tsunami of traffic, venture capitalists to queue up with checks, and instant startup stardom to be theirs‚Äîall before their morning coffee even cools down. But the truth is, launching on Product Hunt is not for everyone. Every week our agency receives a dozen requests from founders looking for help launching on Product Hunt, and we convince 70% of them that they aren‚Äôt ready. So before I get into how to win on Product Hunt, I‚Äôll first try to convince you that Product Hunt might not be the best use of your time right now.The hard truth about Product Hunt launchesOn average, startups that do well on PH invest 50 to 120 hours preparing for launch. Though some startups hit #1 investing very little¬†time, your odds go up significantly if you put in the time. The number of hours required to prepare for a successful campaign varies based on the stage of your product, your experience with PH, and who your users are (i.e. B2B versus B2C). And as Rajiv shared with me, ‚ÄúFounders often launch too late. Most founders I know recommend launching early and often. Product Hunt is a powerful signal on what the market wants, and it‚Äôs worth finding that out as soon as possible.‚ÄùStill, there¬†are also hundreds of startups that launch on Product Hunt each week and see no impact. Why? A mix of reasons: lack of preparation, audience mismatch, or just bad timing, with too much competition on your chosen launch day.With such a large investment of time and team hours, you need to ask yourself‚Äîare there better ways you could be using your time? Especially if you‚Äôre looking for a sustained increase in signups or launching your product for the first time, paid ad campaigns are often a more efficient way to test initial messaging or scale your marketing efforts sustainably.All that being said, for the right product, with a well-executed launch, the impact can be game-changing.A few startups that have shared their metrics publicly include Twinr, a no-code mobile app builder that won Product of the Day. Twinr received 1,000 signups on launch day and has continued to get 150 signups per day since. Wide-appeal B2C launches such as newsletters or productivity tools can result in upward of 3,000 signups. Another prominent example is Air. Their team saw web traffic increase 5x, single-day account creation go up by 8x, and single-day workspace creation increase by 10x. The launch day was also their best day of organic sales leads ever.¬†Product Hunt is a playground for brand awareness, credibility, and social proof among early adopters and tech enthusiasts. It‚Äôs a sweet spot for startups that want to:¬†Catch the eye of tech bloggers, influencers, or investors to raise their next roundDrive a short-term growth boost¬†Receive genuine user feedback from tech enthusiastsLeverage SEO juice from backlink from a high-authority domain like Product HuntOn that last point, a valuable long-tail effect of launching on Product Hunt is the SEO benefit you can reap from landing a high-authority backlink. Especially for brand-new startups that haven‚Äôt focused on their SEO strategy yet, this can make a big difference.Finally, B2C products often see more signups than B2B products, thanks to a broader target market. The average B2B startup might get 50 to 300 signups and consider it a great success, whereas B2C productivity tools can get 500 to 1,500 signups on average.¬†Tip: If you‚Äôre launching a B2B product, you need a smooth, self-serve onboarding flow to make the most of a Product Hunt launch. Product Hunt users are early adopters who love to dive in and explore right away. Delayed access? You‚Äôve lost them.The insider‚Äôs guide to winning Product Hunt¬†So you‚Äôve weighed the pros and cons and decided to go for it. Here are 7 tips that will help you crush your campaign and 5 common myths about Product Hunt that‚Äôll save you a lot of time.1. Set the right goals: aim for conversion over popularityFirst things first‚Äîset a conversion goal for your product. It‚Äôs great to aim for the top spot on Product Hunt, but what actually matters are your business KPIs: website visits, new signups, and trial conversions to paid. These are the metrics that will truly drive your growth. You can use this template to decide on what metrics you are optimizing for.2. Warm up your audience: start 30 days before launchImagine throwing a party and not telling anyone until the day of. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like to launch on Product Hunt without warming up your audience. Start building buzz 30 days in advance of your planned launch. This isn‚Äôt just about letting your close circle know‚Äîit‚Äôs about strategically seeding your launch with people who can amplify your reach.¬†High-level, here‚Äôs what you need to be doing weeks before launch:Build anticipation: Let your community know you‚Äôll be launching on Product Hunt. Plant a seed that you‚Äôll ask for their help later.Account creation: Encourage your network to create a Product Hunt account 30 days prior to your launch date (if they haven‚Äôt already). The Product Hunt community (and algorithm) values engagement from seasoned members more than newcomers.High-value-user engagement: Focus on engaging users who are active on Product Hunt and have a significant following. Their support can be pivotal. More on this in the following sections.Global strategy: Leverage time zones to your advantage. You‚Äôll want users in as many time zones as possible, to spread votes throughout the 24-hour period. Much more on this in the section below.Maker Network: Engage with the community well before your launch. If you are active on Product Hunt in the weeks leading up to your launch and support other makers throughout their launches with meaningful feedback and comments, they are often more than happy to reciprocate the favor and support your launch in turn. Users who have recently launched on Product Hunt have much better response rates than those makers who last posted anything two years ago.¬†Here‚Äôs a template I use with my clients to help them craft these early outreach messages. Remember to focus on connecting with users within your ideal customer profile (ICP). For example, if you already know that your product is particularly popular among product managers, seek these people out on Product Hunt and connect with them on LinkedIn. This will help you not only get your product in front of the general Product Hunt crowd (startup founders, developers, product marketers, and investors) but will increase your outreach conversion rate, as you have tailored it to those Product Hunt users for whom your product is most useful.¬†What happens if you fail to warm up your audience in advance:¬†If your supporters have not signed up to Product Hunt in advance and they create brand-new accounts on launch day to upvote, there is a high likelihood that these votes end up being removed by the Product Hunt algorithm.¬†For a full launch preparation agenda, see our Notion template here.¬†3. Be strategic about launch day: consider time zones and day-of logisticsOnce you start preparing for your launch, your existing network can be your biggest asset during the launch, but you need to plan wisely to mobilize your community most effectively.1. Use time zones to your advantageOne of the most overlooked strategies is playing the time-zone game to your advantage. Spreading your votes throughout the day is crucial, as is launching at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Time. Product Hunt‚Äôs algorithm favors products that maintain a steady stream of engagement. Here‚Äôs a strategy to maximize your visibility:Segment your outreach: Plan at least three major pushes throughout the day to ensure a consistent flow of upvotes‚Äîideally, at 12:01 a.m. PT to announce your launch, at 7 a.m. PT when U.S. users come online, and at 2 p.m. PT to maintain momentum throughout the afternoon.Email drips: If you have a sizable email list, segment it even further. Schedule up to 10 email blasts throughout the day (by time zone if possible, to make sure people are awake). This ensures that your network is engaged and ready to support you at the right time.Engage your entire network: Don‚Äôt leave anyone out. From employees to users and investors, encourage everyone in your circle to participate. Remember, engagement from long-standing Product Hunt accounts is more valuable than a sudden influx of new accounts.Staggered engagement on your social channels: Schedule your social channels as well. Similar to the above, aim for a rollout in waves, following the sun around the globe. This ensures a steady stream of engagement rather than a one-time spike.Local influencers: Identify key influencers in different time zones and get them on board early. Their engagement can trigger others to follow suit.2. Launch-day logisticsAs D-Day approaches, make sure you have a detailed plan for what you‚Äôre going to do throughout the day. Here‚Äôs a template to create your launch-day war plan and assign tasks to your team members.Also, before the big day, double-check your preparations:Engagement plan: Have a clear plan for responding to comments and engaging with the community on Product Hunt throughout the launch day. We recommend having two or three team members on standby who can answer questions with different perspectives. Batching the response process in two-hour intervals usually works best to stay on top of it while keeping your sanity.¬†Monitoring: Set up a schedule to keep an eye on your product‚Äôs performance on Product Hunt, and be ready to adapt your strategy in real time.Personal touch: Reach out to your contacts personally, especially those with a strong Product Hunt presence. A personal message goes a long way.Team effort: If you‚Äôre launching in-house, get your entire team involved. Have them reach out to their networks and inform them about the upcoming launch.Pro tip from Rajiv Ayyangar (CEO of Product Hunt): ‚ÄúOn launch day, don‚Äôt forget to use an embed on your web page that shows live upvotes. It‚Äôs a great way to help your community know about the launch, plus it creates some excitement¬†and shows visual engagement, since¬†the upvotes are live-updating. Plus, you can keep the badge up afterwards.‚Äù4. Pick the right day of the week: your goals determine your dayPicking the right day of the week to launch according to your objectives is a crucial part of successful campaign planning, and one that often gets overlooked by startups. Once you have decided what your launch goals are, pick a day that increases your chances of hitting those objectives.Source: https://compile.blog/product-hunt/best-time-to-post/Mondays and Fridays: These days have great engagement metrics, while having a significantly lower amount of competition.¬†Choose Monday or Friday if getting a higher rank is more important than traffic.¬†Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays: These days have the highest traffic metrics on Product Hunt but also the fiercest competition. Choose one of these days if you are OK ranking in a lower spot but want the highest amount of incoming traffic.¬†Saturdays and Sundays: These days have the absolute best chances to rank in the #1 spot on Product Hunt but have less traffic than weekdays. Choose one of these days if your priority is to give yourself the best chance to rank in the #1 spot to gain more brand awareness, social proof, and credibility. Once ranked in the top spot, few people will check what day of the week it was.Most of our clients aiming to boost brand visibility and establish credibility through Product Hunt‚Äôs #1 badge tend to choose Mondays or Fridays. For those viewing Product Hunt as just another channel for traffic, the midweek days from Tuesday to Thursday are recommended. Remember, the goals you set are crucial, as your launch date is locked in once the page goes live at 12:01 a.m. Should you have a last-minute change of heart and decide you want the top spot but find yourself launching on a bustling Tuesday competing against giants like ChatGPT 5, you‚Äôll be out of luck.5. Understand the Product Hunt algorithm: play by the rulesThe Product Hunt ranking algorithm is a bit of a black box, but several key factors can influence your product‚Äôs visibility:Upvotes: It‚Äôs not just the number but the velocity and timing that count. A sudden spike in votes might raise flags.Engagement: Comments and discussions around your product matter. It shows that the community is genuinely interested. And if you can get reviews or comments from notable Product Hunt users, these will have a significant impact on your ranking, since Product Hunt values users with high ‚Äúkarma‚Äù scores.¬†Upvoter quality: Product Hunt will highlight notable upvotes in your own launch dashboard.Product quality: It goes without saying, but Product Hunt values innovative, well-crafted products.A note on securing hunters with a large following:¬†In the past, having a big hunter was super-valuable, because all of their followers received notifications when they hunted a new product. But this does not happen anymore, so the additional visibility boost is gone. However, securing the support from a well-known hunter‚Äîespecially one with an interest and background in your product category‚Äîcan still be helpful for receiving valuable feedback in the comment sections, as outlined above.¬†Beware of the pitfalls:Launch parties: While it might seem like a great idea to gather everyone for a voting party at launch, simultaneous votes from the same location can trigger spam filters, leading to a shadow ban.Community support: In the past, Product Hunt communities (oftentimes these were secretive upvoting rings) would band together to support each other‚Äôs launches. However, recent changes have started to crack down on these practices to ensure fairness.Bots and fake accounts: Similar to how 500 new signups from your own users on launch day can trigger the Product Hunt algorithm, competitors can intentionally abuse this tactic by deploying bots and flooding products with newly created accounts to provoke deranking and gain an edge for themselves.¬†If you notice an influx of comments from new users (as indicated by a red balloon next to their name), use the reporting function to mark them as spam. This helps Product Hunt keep the platform legitimate.6. Invest in the right assets: spend time on these four elementsWhen building marketing assets for a Product Hunt launch, it‚Äôs crucial to tailor your content to both the platform‚Äôs unique environment and its audience of tech enthusiasts, early adopters, and industry influencers. Here are the most critical asset categories to focus on:TaglineThis is one of the most important marketing assets you will create. The tagline is the main CTA that will incentivize users to click from the Product Hunt home page to your actual product page, which is the first hurdle to overcome. This makes it quite important to choose a tagline that evokes curiosity.Pro tip from Rajiv Ayyangar (CEO of Product Hunt): ‚ÄúA common failure mode is trying to make a tagline seem grander but in the process losing clarity (e.g. ‚ÄòAn AI platform to turbocharge...‚Äô). Make sure it‚Äôs both compelling and clear.‚ÄùExample of a great tagline that clearly outlines the value propositionIf you can, include an action verb and call people to action.A few examples to give you a better idea:¬†‚ÄúMake Chrome faster and use 10x less memory‚Äù¬†‚ÄúFind the best SEO tools for the job‚Äù¬†‚ÄúLaunch your own swag store in 3 easy steps‚ÄùHigh-quality imagesEnsure that your visuals are high-resolution and clearly communicate your product‚Äôs value proposition. Product Hunt allows for multiple images, so make sure to showcase different facets of your product.Pro tip from Rajiv Ayyangar (CEO of Product Hunt): ‚ÄúTo be even more explicit: Show the UI. The PH community wants to know what your product looks like!‚ÄùWe always recommend embedding captions within the image itself so the audience knows exactly what they are seeing in the product screenshot (see examples below). We recommend a minimum of three images.Example of a gallery image where the captions straightforwardly outline the value prop:VideoIf you are creating a video, we typically recommend a product walkthrough, which comes across as very relatable. A simple Loom recording of you walking through the product is often a great option that doesn‚Äôt require a huge time investment.Here‚Äôs an example of a simple but powerful demo walkthrough created by the maker team: Highly polished videos often require large time and resource investments (four weeks for a professionally made product teaser can be common, and running up to $10,000 in creative costs). Yet the video is only a small piece of what makes a launch successful.If you do decide to go with a video, the recommended time is around three to five minutes, and it should be a YouTube link that is not set to private. Try to avoid using a link that will only go live at the time of the launch, in case there are tech issues.Maker‚Äôs commentThis is where you reel the audience in and tell your origin story. Start by describing what pain points you encountered in the past motivated you to create the product. What makes it unique, and how is it different from other competitors in the market? What is your mission for the product, and what value prop are you focusing on?Finish off the maker‚Äôs comment with a quick outline of how people can get started using the product, and add a discount code to your CTA if you have one. The Product Hunt audience loves free trials!Here‚Äôs a great example:7. Going beyond upvotes: comments and reviews matter, for a different reasonWhen launching on Product Hunt, it‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the race for upvotes. But let‚Äôs take a step back, rethink that approach, and remember the metrics you set. It‚Äôs not just about hitting that top spot; you want meaningful engagement, valuable feedback, and, most importantly, conversion (both on launch day and beyond).¬†Positive feedback converts an audienceGenuine, positive feedback can dramatically increase the conversion rate from your Product Hunt page to your website. Many users will check out the review section of your product to see what others think. The quality of these reviews will have a big impact on how many people will click through to your website and sign up. Think of this as the Amazon reviews section for SaaS products. One-liner reviews don‚Äôt drive purchasing decisions. If you can get some of your current power users to chime in on what they love about your product, this will usually drive the best results.The power of engagementEngagement in the form of comments on your launch page can significantly impact your product‚Äôs success. While the algorithm values quality engagement over quantity, a high number of comments on your page can increase the click-through rate from the Product Hunt home page to your launch page.¬†Five myths about launching on Product Hunt that could cost you a ton of time and impactThis post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

Simplify security | Jira Product Discovery‚ÄîAtlassian‚Äôs new prioritization and roadmapping tool built for product teams | Teal‚ÄîYour personal career growth platform‚ÄîNir Eyal is the author of two best-selling books, Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life. He writes, consults, and teaches at the intersection of psychology, technology, and business. His books have sold over 1 million copies in more than 30 languages; he has taught at Stanford‚Äôs Graduate School of Business and its Design School; and he has started and sold two startups since 2003. In our conversation, we discuss:‚Ä¢ Strategies for becoming less distractible and improving focus‚Ä¢ The difference between distraction and ‚Äútraction‚Äù‚Ä¢ Reactive work vs. reflexive work and why you should book time in your calendar‚Ä¢ The 10-minute rule to overcome internal triggers and stay focused‚Ä¢ The problem with to-do lists, and what to do instead‚Ä¢ The value of creating a timebox schedule that aligns with personal values and priorities‚Ä¢ The use of pacts as a last line of defense against distraction‚Ä¢ How to develop a high-agency mindset‚Ä¢ Advice for leaders on helping employees improve focus in the workplaceSome takeaways:Because distraction largely stems from your internal psychology, it‚Äôs very much within your control‚Äîif you apply the right tools.A tactic: When you feel an urge to do something distracting‚Äîlike scroll on your phone‚Äîtry to delay doing it for just 10 more minutes. You‚Äôre not saying ‚Äúno,‚Äù you‚Äôre just saying ‚Äúnot yet.‚Äù¬†After 10 minutes have passed, you‚Äôll often find the urge has disappeared.Turn your values into time by putting things in your calendar like prayer, meditation, and exercise.Calendars are better than to-do lists. To-do lists set you up for failure by letting you add more tasks than you have time for. Calendars force you to contend with the limited number of hours in a day.Use pacts, like price pacts (e.g. I‚Äôll pay someone if I break this pact) and identity pacts (e.g. I‚Äôm someone who works out), as a last line of defense against distraction.Listen now on Apple, Spotify, Overcast, and YouTube.Find the full transcript at: https://www.lennyspodcast.com/strategies-for-becoming-less-distracted-and-improving-focus-nir-eyal-author-of-indistractable-and/Where to find Nir Eyal:‚Ä¢ X: https://twitter.com/nireyal‚Ä¢ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nireyal/‚Ä¢ Website: https://www.nirandfar.com/Where to find Lenny:‚Ä¢ Newsletter: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com‚Ä¢ X: https://twitter.com/lennysan‚Ä¢ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennyrachitsky/In this episode, we cover:(00:00) Nir‚Äôs background (04:20) How to become less distractible (07:43) Understanding distraction and traction (12:52) The four steps to becoming indistractable (13:53) Mastering internal triggers (18:49) Surfing the urge with a 10-minute timer (23:20) Making time for traction with a timebox schedule (25:02) How to turn your values into time (28:36) Booking deep work time (29:22) Making pacts to prevent distraction (31:00) The problem with to-do lists (34:31) The drawback of deadlines (36:08) Distraction is an emotion regulation problem (39:54) Hacking back external triggers (45:03) Preventing distraction with pacts (48:18) Specific tools to hold you accountable (53:42) Managing emotions and discomfort (56:37) Taking responsibility and being high-agency (01:00:09) Becoming indistractable at work (01:05:04) Schedule syncing to align with managers (01:09:36) We are not as hooked on technology as people think (01:16:00) Life purpose and personal responsibility (01:17:38) Lightning roundReferenced:‚Ä¢ Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life: https://www.amazon.com/Indistractable-Control-Your-Attention-Choose/dp/194883653X‚Ä¢ Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products: https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788‚Ä¢ Dorothy Parker‚Äôs quote: https://twitter.com/nireyal/status/1472280598723108866‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWriting is bleeding‚Äù quote: https://www.hemingwaysociety.org/quotation-controversy-writing-and-bleeding‚Ä¢ The Pomodoro Technique Explained: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2020/03/03/the-pomodoro-technique/‚Ä¢ Timeboxing: Why It Works and How to Get Started in 2024: https://www.nirandfar.com/timeboxing/‚Ä¢ Using your working time well - Issue 22: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/time-management-issue-22‚Ä¢ All-In podcast: https://www.allinpodcast.co/‚Ä¢ Nir‚Äôs post about ‚Äúthe planning fallacy‚Äù: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nireyal_why-do-tasks-always-seem-to-take-longer-than-activity-7137440438939959297-XIUB/‚Ä¢ How the Ancient Greeks Beat Distraction: https://www.nirandfar.com/tantalizing-distractions/‚Ä¢ Jeremy Bentham: https://iep.utm.edu/jeremy-bentham‚Ä¢ An overview of Sigmund Freud‚Äôs pleasure principle: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/pleasure-principle‚Ä¢ The Matrix ‚ÄúThere is no spoon‚Äù scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAXtO5dMqEI‚Ä¢ Outlet timer: https://www.amazon.com/Century-Indoor-24-Hour-Mechanical-Outlet/dp/B01LPSGBZS‚Ä¢ Forest app: https://www.forestapp.cc/‚Ä¢ Focusmate: https://www.focusmate.com/‚Ä¢ Have We Been Thinking About Willpower the Wrong Way for 30 Years?: https://hbr.org/2016/11/have-we-been-thinking-about-willpower-the-wrong-way-for-30-years‚Ä¢ We Need Social Antibodies to Fight the Disease of Distraction: https://nireyal.medium.com/we-need-social-antibodies-to-fight-the-disease-of-distraction-51f9187be016‚Ä¢ The Mere Presence of Your Smartphone Reduces Brain Power, Study Shows: https://news.utexas.edu/2017/06/26/the-mere-presence-of-your-smartphone-reduces-brain-power‚Ä¢ Leading in Tough Times: HBS Faculty Member Amy C.

Tailor your approach to reteaming based on the specific needs of your organization.Isolation can be a powerful driver of innovation. Maximize the impact of these teams by placing them somewhere separate, giving them process freedom, and outlining clear decision-making structures.Listening is a muscle you can build. Start by being aware of internal distractions (level one), redirect your attention outward to focus on the speaker (level two), and expand your awareness to the environment and non-verbal cues (level three).

Lessons learned from a startup that didn‚Äôt make it

Each week I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career. If you‚Äôre not a subscriber, here‚Äôs what you‚Äôve missed:A guide for finding product-market fit in B2BHow Linear builds productHow to build a killer sales pitchHiring your early teamScaling your B2B growth engineThe Magic LoopSubscribe to get access to these posts, and every post.SubscribeFailure has a lot to teach us. But we usually miss our chance to learn from it.Recently, in the process of shutting down his startup, Jake Fuentes (co-founder and CEO of Cascade) jotted down his biggest lessons from the journey. I found them incredibly insightful, and applicable to most startups and product teams, so I asked him if I could share them broadly. Below, Jake offers his hard-won lessons about what people forget about competition, how early market signal is often deceiving, what it takes to build horizontal products, the danger of unfocused ICPs, and more. These lessons are especially timely with the conclusion of my recent B2B series.For more from Jake, follow him on LinkedIn and X. He also advises companies considering acquisitions or other strategic options. Learn more and get in touch on his website.‚ÄúSo, what did you learn?‚ÄùIt‚Äôs meant to be a simple question, asked by friends and family in the months after the end of a startup journey. But when looking back on a company that didn‚Äôt go the distance, so many lessons emerge that it‚Äôs daunting to find an equally simple answer. That said, I‚Äôm struck by a few key decisions we made that seemed sound at the time but that ended up having a profound impact on the company‚Äôs direction. I doubt we‚Äôre the only team to face those junctures‚Äîperhaps our hindsight can serve as a tiny bit of foresight for others.We started Cascade in 2019 destined for glory. Both founders were repeat entrepreneurs¬†with prior exits, we were backed by top investors including First Round Capital and Redpoint, and we had a spectacular starting team. We sat at the intersection of the no-code wave and the red-hot data space: our product gave non-technical teams a way to import, analyze, and visualize large data sets and present their findings via an interactive data app. In our previous companies, we had been surrounded by ambitious but nontechnical business analysts, and we saw how much time they spent fighting Excel and updating charts in PowerPoint. Over the next four years, Cascade raised a $5.3 million seed round, grew to be a team of 10, and served some marquee customers. However, without a clear path to breakout growth, in 2023 we decided to pursue a soft landing.Cascade‚Äôs visual data logic builderHere‚Äôs what we learned.If you allow your ICP to fray, you‚Äôll loseFrom the beginning, we knew we needed to define a good ideal customer profile (ICP). There are many approaches to defining a good ICP, but a quality we underestimated is specificity. Simply put, an ICP must be a single market segment: a group of people for whom the value of solving a problem is roughly the same, and who can be reached in roughly the same way. ‚ÄúPeople who use Excel‚Äù is not a market segment, because it says nothing about either the value of their problem or how to reach them. ‚ÄúMarketers who use Excel to build content calendars at Fortune 500 companies‚Äù could be a good market segment, depending on how you reach them.We defined our ICP as nontechnical business analysts using Excel to crunch big data sets. In retrospect, that was much too broad, particularly because it said nothing about why they were using Excel or the value of the problem they were solving with it. So we ended up with a large basket of ICPs: a scooter company used us to manage location data, an HR team used us to manage employee data, and a retailer used us to analyze distribution. We didn‚Äôt really have a framework for accepting one and rejecting another, so we tried to support them all.One of the vigorous debates over what customers fit our target profile (for real)If we had a properly defined ICP, we would have seen it start to fray with each new use case. ICP fray confuses every decision for a very simple reason: to know what problem you‚Äôre solving, you need to know who you‚Äôre solving it for. On the journey to product-market fit, we know products often change quickly. But the chances of finding fit go down dramatically if the market is changing as well. Therefore, every other decision is downstream of a clear definition of who your audience is. Encountering demand outside of your ICP may seem like a good thing, but be very careful about supporting those customers and expanding to a new segment. Yes, you may discover a whole new market for your product, but along the way, recognize that you‚Äôre allowing your customer focus to fray. Either validate the new market segment and pivot into it, or stick to your guns and move on.Horizontal products are only as good as their best vertical use caseWe justified our broad approach and basket of use cases because we thought about ourselves as a horizontal product (a toolkit built for multiple use cases rather than a single solution). We looked at Airtable, Notion, and Webflow as successful examples of horizontal plays, and we salivated when thinking about the aggregate TAM of all the use cases we could support.¬†We needed to remember that our customers do not care about our TAM. All they care about is their specific set of problems. Building a horizontal tool is especially hard, because each supported use case often competes with a tailor-made, vertical solution. If we had tried to build a whole business around the scooter company that was using Cascade to manage logistics, we would have quickly run up against Samsara and Onfleet.Horizontal products win if a specific audience encounters enough use cases that they want one tool to address them all. Figma won because it captured a much larger portion of an app designer‚Äôs workflow than Sketch or Illustrator did. Notion won because it addressed the vast array of documentation tasks faced by product managers in San Francisco. In both cases, a specific buyer encountered a large array of problems, so a horizontal toolkit was the best solution.As we took Cascade to market, we were dismayed to find that the business analyst role had changed, making us less relevant. A lot of big-data wrangling and analysis was being shifted to more technical data teams, for whom Cascade had little value. Business analysts at midsize companies no longer faced the diversity of analytical problems they used to, which meant that more opinionated, targeted products could pick up what was left. The diversity problem still existed upmarket, but that meant we would have to build a large number of enterprise features in addition to what we had.¬†We knew that horizontal tools often must survive a very long, uncertain journey toward product-market fit in order to support all the use cases they need to. During that time, we knew our customers would reject the product for ambiguous reasons, our team would second-guess our strategy, and our investors would tell us to pivot. We stuck to our guns for over three years, convinced that we could build our way out of it. But the further we got, the more it felt like we had landed on a melting island.A competitive product being old and clunky doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs vulnerableWe thought we had landed on a startup gold mine. Alteryx, an early-2000s-era software company, was about to clear a billion dollars in annual revenue. Their only product was a Windows-only, clunky desktop application for which each user paid over $5,000 a year. They were the only player in their esoteric market and seemed incapable of delivering anything that resembled modern software. Getting the application started took several incantations and a minor miracle, and one look at the interface revealed a stark contrast with the lightweight, browser-native applications we were used to. We set out to build a competitor, confident that we could out-execute them and steal major market share.Alteryx‚Äôs Designer desktop applicationThe problem was that Alteryx users actually liked the product. It was clunky and probably needed to be moved to the cloud, but it delivered on its promise, giving its nontechnical users the ability to build logic the way their engineering teams did. Over the past 15 years, it had also amassed a community that helped each other solve complex data problems. The desktop app was a big part of the offering, but the community had helped solidify its moat.We chalked all that up to the fact that users had no real alternative. Besides, we knew that Alteryx was horrendously expensive, which left buyers frustrated even if end users were not. While most of their customers were not actively seeking an alternative, cost alone led to reasonable success getting companies to evaluate their options. If we could overcome switching costs, we saw a path to real growth.Generally, teams think about switching costs as the amount of time and money needed to install one solution and remove another. But true switching costs are much more than that: they include the politics, emotions, career ambitions, esoteric business processes, competing priorities, and sheer laziness that all favor the existing solution. Those forces can be incredibly strong, working to ensure that inferior products can still win (have you ever used Bill.com, Concur, or even Salesforce?).Concur‚Äôs continued success is another living example that inferior products can winIn our case, we underestimated how deeply Alteryx was integrated into company processes. Only a couple of people inside those companies actually knew how Alteryx worked, and hell would freeze over before we convinced them to abandon a career-defining tool. While ‚Äúnormal‚Äù users were willing to switch, we didn‚Äôt go far enough to facilitate replacing old work and to convince power users that we were the future. We thought the product would speak for itself. While it did to some degree, we needed more.¬†Many old-school companies seem ripe for disruption but are actually much stronger than they appear. Others appear strong but are secretly vulnerable. If only the user is frustrated, you‚Äôll have a hard time winning. If only the buyer is frustrated, you have a path to victory as long as you can overcome switching costs. Only direct input from customers will reveal the true story.¬†Don‚Äôt confuse people rooting for you with market signalOn some level, all founders suffer from ‚Äúhappy ears‚Äù‚Äîthe chronic confirmation bias pervading conversations with customers, partners, team members, and investors. We tend to have irrational levels of confidence anyway, but that gets compounded when we mistake support for market signal. Most commonly, founders believe that investor checks signal that they‚Äôre on the right track. That could be true, but at the seed stage, investors often make a broad bet on the team, trusting that they‚Äôll figure something out. If founders read more into an investment than that, they might double down on a bad strategy because of some perceived investor confidence.The phenomenon goes further than investors. Before a product can speak for itself, a company‚Äôs earliest deals are often done on the backs of the founders‚Äô personal relationships. While those early deals are often critical to the company‚Äôs survival, they‚Äôre also not true market signal. Your supporters will be rooting for you and want you to succeed, and at times they‚Äôll be in a position to accelerate your progress. Unbeknown to them, sometimes they can accelerate you in the wrong direction.That‚Äôs especially true if you have a product like Cascade, which has multiple use cases and a broad value proposition. Our customers hired us because they liked or trusted us and because the founders were involved in the deal. But once the founders stepped out of the room, things got a lot more difficult. The founding team could push the car forward, but we mistook that movement for a machine that could run on its own. Once we stopped pushing, the car stopped.Looking back, I‚Äôm struck by the insane number of forces pulling companies away from product-market fit. Founders need to plow through a murky market, propelling their journey with the right team, stepping over competitive land mines, turning based on the right feedback but not the wrong feedback, and suppressing their own biases in order to see their environment clearly. Along the way, we often look to learn from companies that have gone the distance, succeeding in spite of the odds. But success stories (and the revisionist narratives told about them) often don‚Äôt do enough to highlight the common misconceptions, obstacles, or mirages that face new companies. I hope our story, with all of its ups and downs, will add a few more signposts along the road.The Cascade team at a retreat in ColoradoHave a fulfilling and productive week üôèüì£ Join Lenny‚Äôs Talent Collective üì£If you‚Äôre hiring, I can help.

I basically started my data journey with Alteryx and Tableau. On Alteryx you forgot to say they grew a lot by siding with Tableau, they had their ICP well defined in that case: Tableau users that needed to do quick data modelling for their dashboards. Tableau Prep came a lot later and now PowerBI has its own modelling tool, so in fact I think Alteryx is in trouble now, less so 3 years ago. I likes your analysis, especially your insight on horizontal tools, I am in fact trying to go vertical myself now after trying to sell an horizontal tool for about 1 year. I would recommend to include in the team someone who has done enterprise work or sales next time, UI is never the problem with Enterprose tools, you need to fit in the internal narrative of the Enterprise buying committee, and they will always go for whatever they thing is ‚Äústandard‚Äù or ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù at the moment.Expand full commentReplyShare1 reply13 more comments...TopNewCommunityNo postsReady for more?Subscribe¬© 2024 Substack IncPrivacy ‚àô Terms ‚àô Collection notice Start WritingGet the appSubstack is the home for great writing

She previously served as vice president of product data science and engineering, and as vice president of data and insights, at Netflix. Before Netflix, Elizabeth was vice president of science at Lyft, chief operating officer at Nuna, a trader at Merrill Lynch, and an economist at Analysis Group. In our conversation, we discuss:Elizabeth‚Äôs advice for career advancementNetflix‚Äôs unique high-performance cultureHow, and why, Netflix maintains a high bar for excellenceIntentional leadership practicesHow to foster an ‚Äúopen door‚Äù culture within your teamThe Keeper Test and how it contributes to maintaining a high bar for excellenceThe power of transparent communicationMuch moreSome takeaways:Netflix uses the Keeper Test to facilitate real-time conversations about employee expectations and performance. The test involves a leader asking themselves: ‚ÄúWould I fight to keep this employee if they were considering leaving?‚Äù If not, it may be time to have a tough conversation with the employee about why that is.Maintaining a high bar for excellence requires ongoing feedback and open conversations. Netflix does not have a structured performance review system; instead it relies on ongoing conversations and the annual 360 feedback process. The annual cycle focuses on gathering feedback for the sake of improvement rather than assigning ratings.Netflix‚Äôs bottom-up culture doesn‚Äôt work without high talent density. Operating a company with informal performance reviews and limited planning processes requires competent, driven, and trustworthy individuals. Continuously hiring people who raise the bar is crucial to their culture functioning at scale.The company values transparency and open communication from everyone, including leadership. Leaders practice transparency by taking notes in meetings and sharing those notes with the whole organization. This includes reflections on challenges, problems to solve, and what is top of mind for the leadership team. This level of transparency helps build a sense of community and trust across the organization.Netflix keeps its data and insights teams centralized. This structure allows the team to work on various problem spaces, collaborate effectively, maintain functional expertise, and provide objective insights and analysis for the organization.Listen now on Apple, Spotify, Overcast, and YouTube.Find the full transcript at: https://www.lennyspodcast.com/how-netflix-builds-a-culture-of-excellence-elizabeth-stone-cto/Where to find Elizabeth Stone:‚Ä¢ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-stone-608a754/Where to find Lenny:‚Ä¢ Newsletter: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com‚Ä¢ X: https://twitter.com/lennysan‚Ä¢ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennyrachitsky/In this episode, we cover:(00:00) Elizabeth‚Äôs background (04:36) Life as CTO vs. VP of Data (05:57) The role of economists in tech companies (08:32) Using economics to understand incentives (10:07) Success and career growth (20:15) Setting expectations (25:02) Advice for how to avoid burnout (27:44) Netflix culture: high talent density (30:31) Netflix culture: candor and directness (31:45) The Keeper Test (39:01) Maintaining a high bar for excellence (43:54) Netflix culture: freedom and responsibility (46:18) Unconventional processes at Netflix (47:55) Examples of candor (51:44) Data and insights team structure (01:00:12) Staying close to teams (01:02:31) Advice on being present (01:07:40) Lightning roundReferenced:‚Ä¢ What to Know About the Netflix Cup, Today‚Äôs First-Ever Live Sports Event: https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/netflix-cup-live-event-date-news‚Ä¢ Ann Miura Ko interview | The Tim Ferriss Show (Podcast): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2GO0Ks_VGg‚Ä¢ Netflix culture: https://jobs.netflix.com/culture‚Ä¢ No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention: https://www.amazon.com/No-Rules-Netflix-Culture-Reinvention/dp/1984877860‚Ä¢ Reed Hastings on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/reedhastings/‚Ä¢ Netflix‚Äôs ‚ÄúKeeper Test‚Äù and Why You Need It | Lorne Rubis: https://www.highlights.lornerubis.com/2015/08/the-netflix-keeper-test-and-the-courage-to-take-it/‚Ä¢ The Hunger Games: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games‚Ä¢ Nan Yu on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/thenanyu/‚Ä¢ Work Life Philosophy: https://jobs.netflix.com/work-life-philosophy‚Ä¢ The Scoop: Netflix‚Äôs historic introduction of levels for software engineers: https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/netflix-levels/‚Ä¢ Chaos Monkey: https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Chaos-Monkey‚Ä¢ Ali Rauh on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-rauh/‚Ä¢ Keith Henwood on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-henwood/‚Ä¢ Jeff Bezos‚Äô Morning Routine of Puttering Around‚ÄîHow It Works: https://medium.com/illumination/jeff-bezos-morning-routine-of-puttering-around-how-it-works-9d73f359ac8d‚Ä¢ What I Talk About When I Talk About Running: A Memoir: https://www.amazon.com/What-Talk-About-When-Running/dp/0307389839‚Ä¢ A Fine Balance: https://www.amazon.com/Fine-Balance-Rohinton-Mistry/dp/140003065X‚Ä¢ Triangle of Sadness on Hulu: https://www.hulu.com/movie/triangle-of-sadness-f60937bd-45f4-469a-938f-db95026953a1‚Ä¢ Beef on Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/title/81447461‚Ä¢ Fellow pour-over coffee set: https://fellowproducts.com/products/stagg-xf-pour-over-set‚Ä¢ Peloton bikes: https://www.onepeloton.com/shop/bikeProduction and marketing by https://penname.co/.

Art by Natalie Harney.Although we‚Äôve reached the end of this journey, we‚Äôre on a journey that never ends. Building a venture-scale business means endless challenges, surprises, and an unrelenting need for growth. I like to think of the startup journey as a huge puzzle board, where every challenge, decision, and opportunity is a piece of the puzzle. My job is to (slowly but surely) fill in this board and help you through every challenge, decision, and opportunity you‚Äôll face.For reference, here are some puzzle pieces I‚Äôve already put into place to help you scale your B2B startup prior to this series:On growth and GTMGTM motions of 30 B2B SaaS companiesPicking a wedgeDifferentiatingPositioningThe Racecar FrameworkWhat is good retentionWhat is a good activation rateWhat is a good payback periodOn salesHow to do founder-led salesHow to build a killer sales pitchLayering sales on top of a PLG motionAdding a PLG motion on top of a sales-led motionHow to hit revenue targets in a recessionOn pricing strategyThe art and science of pricingPricing strategy for your SaaS productOn fundraisingA playbook for fundraisingYour startup idea probably isn‚Äôt venture-scaleToday, I‚Äôll answer four additional questions:What‚Äôs a good timeline to get to $1 million ARR?What are the most common growth channels for B2B startups?When should you start charging for your product?What should you charge?Let‚Äôs get into it.Typical times to get to $1M ARROn average, it took top B2B startups ~2 years from founding to hit $1m ARR, and roughly 1.5 years after closing their first customer. There are exceptions, like Ramp, Linear, Census, and Zip, that got there more quickly (some within months), and also companies like Loom and Vanta that took 2+ years.My takeaway is that once you‚Äôve signed your first customer, you should strive to hit $1m ARR within 1.5 years if you want to be on pace with the top B2B companies.Interestingly, there isn‚Äôt a large difference in timelines between companies with large ACVs (e.g. Looker, Gong, Sprig, Vanta) and low ACVs (e.g. Loom, Figma).Also, in some instances, there‚Äôs good reason to push out monetization. In the case of Loom, co-founder Shahed Khan shared, ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt monetize Loom for several years intentionally, as our focus was to become a ubiquitous tool within organizations. Thus it took us four years to hit $1m ARR.‚Äù With the recent acquisition news, seems like a good call.How B2B startups grow as they scalePrimary growth channels for top B2B companiesBroadly, the biggest growth channel for top B2B companies (at least the 20+ I researched) is organic inbound. Essentially, word of mouth. This connects with a key lesson from part five of this series‚Äîthat strong product-market fit often looks like strong organic growth. That being said, as we saw in part six, eventually 100% of B2B businesses build a sales team.Below I‚Äôll explore all six B2B growth channels: self-serve organic inbound, sales-assist organic inbound, outbound sales, content/SEO, paid ads, and partnerships. This summary doesn‚Äôt get into revenue expansion (e.g. growing revenue from existing customers), since it didn‚Äôt come up in my interviews, but this is also a massive growth lever for scaling B2B SaaS companies, and I‚Äôll spend more time here in future posts.Use this list not as ‚Äúwe should do all of these,‚Äù but instead as inspiration for one new channel to explore for your own product. You‚Äôre likely already growing primarily through one of the first three channels; ask yourself which of the remaining channels might be a new opportunity.1. Organic inbound: Self-serve (aka Product-Led Growth)This channel is simply users hearing about your product from someone else (or being invited) and signing up on their own. No one from your company helps them through the funnel. This isn‚Äôt to say salespeople never talk to these leads (check out this podcast episode on product-led sales), but it does mean new customers come primarily from them first trying the product on their own. Companies like Loom, Figma, Segment, Gusto, Hex, and Linear grow primarily in this way.What this looks like:‚ÄúPeople in trials are checking out with credit cards, without us talking to them.‚Äù‚ÄúSigning up for Loom after watching someone else‚Äôs Loom (typically coworkers), within Slack or in Salesforce, Linear task, or Notion doc.‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always had a strong stream of inbound users who had found out about us via our open source work and propelled us through our early revenue milestones.‚Äù2. Organic inbound: Sales-assistSimilar to the above channel, new customers come to you, but in this case, your sales team hand-holds leads through the process. Companies like Looker, Ramp, Vanta, Hex, Census, Persona, and some portion of Amplitude and Segment grow through this channel. The key determinant of whether you go self-service or sales-assist is how successfully new users can get activated without handholding.What this looks like:‚ÄúOur biggest growth channel by far is organic, with visitors to our site clicking the ‚ÄòRequest a demo‚Äô button.‚Äù‚ÄúCustomer referrals continues to be one of our strongest channels, which funnels into our inbound sales pipeline.‚Äù‚ÄúAll of our growth is inbound, but it‚Äôs all sales-touch.‚Äù3. Outbound salesThis is what you think of when you think of sales-led growth‚Äîyour sales team reaches out to prospects, pitches them, and closes them. Companies that grow primarily through this channel include Gong and Zip, along with a meaningful portion of growth for Ramp and Segment. I‚Äôll be doing more writing on this topic in the coming months, so stay tuned.4. Content/SEOA surprisingly popular growth channel for top B2B companies is content. Companies like Vanta, Amplitude, Figma, Persona, and, famously, HubSpot have all found success using content (aka SEO) to grow. I‚Äôve covered this topic in depth previously, so go read this if you‚Äôre looking to invest here.5. Paid ads They may be boring, but paid ads work. For B2B, this means running ads on Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, along with the occasional ad on podcasts, newsletters, and other less-scalable channels. Companies that have found success here include both large (Figma and Amplitude) and smaller (Vanta and Census). For advice on running paid ads, here‚Äôs a good podcast episode to check out.6. PartnershipsPartnerships: huge if successful, massive time suck if not. This is a meaningful growth channel for companies like Census, Hex, and Zip, but as one founder shared, ‚ÄúWe have a big channel partnership with Snowflake, and though this doesn‚Äôt drive a big percentage of our leads, it does help to have that relationship.‚Äù I‚Äôve written about channel partnerships before, so go read this if you‚Äôd like more examples and advice.A few additional takeawaysMost of your growth will come from one of the top three: inbound self-service, inbound sales-assist, or outbound sales. Spend most of your time optimizing that channel.No matter how you start, you‚Äôll be building a sales team. It‚Äôs a question of when, not if.Creating content (e.g. blog posts, LinkedIn posts, viral tweets, a great podcast) seems to be effective for a number of companies, so it‚Äôs worth exploring. But think about the system that can allow this to scale, versus one-off efforts. Think engines, not turbo boosts.Be careful about forcing PLG. Here‚Äôs Ali Ghodsi (founder and CEO of Databricks)‚Äôs cautionary tale:‚ÄúThe whole vision of Databricks was we don‚Äôt want to have sales in the company. It‚Äôs going to all be product-led growth. So it‚Äôs a hundred percent product-led-growth motion. And in 2015, we kind of doubled down on it. We actually said, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs do what Amazon did. Let‚Äôs just make it really slick, and you swipe your credit card and you can start using this stuff.‚Äô We called it the zero-touch effort. We were going to touch the customers zero times from a sales perspective. No human needed to touch the customer. We‚Äôre very excited about that and we built it all, we automated it all. And I think around Q2 of 2015, we told sales, ‚ÄòStop engaging with the customers. This is going to be zero-touch. Focus all your attention on automating this stuff and let‚Äôs set it up for that kind of motion.‚ÄôAnd actually, revenue flatlined. Revenue was growing, and then in Q2, Q3 of 2015, it started flattening. So around Q4 it was starting to become kind of clear that, okay, this product-led-growth thing‚Äînice story, but in practice, it doesn‚Äôt really work. Which is actually, by the way, my view. I think for all practical purposes, PLG doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs a ‚Äòdon‚Äôt try it at home‚Äô kind of thing. Maybe it works for Atlassian. Maybe if you can swipe a credit card and use the product in five minutes, it‚Äôll work. But if you think this is how you can sell to enterprises, without a sales force, good luck.‚ÄùWhen and how much to chargeThese are the four key lessons that came up again and again when I talked to founders about their pricing strategy:This post is for paid subscribersSubscribeAlready a paid subscriber?

His direct reports have gone on to lead user research at Figma, Notion, Slack, Robinhood, Duolingo, AllTrails, and more. In our conversation, we unpack the transformation that the user-research field is experiencing. Specifically:Where user research went wrong over the past decadeThe three types of research‚Äîmacro, middle-range, and micro‚Äîand the purpose of eachHow to effectively integrate researchers into the product development processThe ‚Äúuser-centered performance‚Äù phenomenon and why it‚Äôs a waste of timeCommon tropes about PMs, from researchersThe ideal ratio of researchers in a companyWhy Judd says NPS is useless, and what to use insteadSome takeaways:User research has been significantly impacted by layoffs, and with new market dynamics, there is a need for a shift in the way user research is conducted.The wrong type of user research is being conducted most of the time, with a focus on ‚Äúmiddle-range‚Äù topics, which are interesting but not impactful enough for the business.Researchers need to become business-oriented and focus on finding the overlap between user needs and business goals, not just user needs.Integrating research from the beginning of the product development process is crucial for leveraging your user researcher best.Consider shifting from NPS to CSAT for more accurate and useful feedback.Listen now on Apple, Spotify, Overcast, and YouTube.Find the full

Simplify security.‚ÄîMegan Cook is the head of product for Atlassian‚Äôs Jira software, which is used by 75% of Fortune 500 companies, has over 125,000 customers globally, over 15 different products, and is by far the most popular project management tool in the world. Megan has been at Atlassian for just under 11 years, and before this role, she was an analyst, a developer, and an Agile coach. In our conversation, we discuss:‚Ä¢ How to get buy-in for your ideas‚Ä¢ The value of starting small‚Ä¢ How, and why, creating space for play is so essential‚Ä¢ How Jira stays ahead of endless competition‚Ä¢ Atlassian‚Äôs approach to launching new product lines‚Ä¢ Tactical tips for making remote work, work‚Ä¢ A personal failure and the lessons learned from itSome takeaways:Boost relationships and collaboration in remote work by structuring team gatherings. Whether for work or leisure, these sessions, including collaborative work sessions, workshops, and casual interactions, mimic the benefits of in-office dynamics, contributing to sustained productivity.Adopt a startup mindset when launching a new product line. Start small and focus on proving the idea without overcommitting resources. This approach allows experimentation and the discovery of innovative solutions that can benefit the broader product portfolio over time.Getting buy-in is a journey, not a one-time event. If you‚Äôre proposing a change, try to meet with all the impacted stakeholders early on in the process. Explain to them what you‚Äôre doing, listen to their point of view, fold in their feedback, and repeat. When stakeholders help craft your idea, they‚Äôre much more likely to buy into it.Listen now on Apple, Spotify, Overcast, and YouTube.Find the full transcript at: https://www.lennyspodcast.com/lessons-from-atlassian-launching-new-products-getting-buy-in-and-staying-ahead-of-the-competition/Where to find Megan Cook:‚Ä¢ X: https://twitter.com/meganwcook‚Ä¢ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cookmeganWhere to find Lenny:‚Ä¢ Newsletter: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com‚Ä¢ X: https://twitter.com/lennysan‚Ä¢ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennyrachitsky/In this episode, we cover:(00:00) Megan‚Äôs background (03:50) Creating space for play and psychological safety on teams (07:36) Peer feedback groups (10:30) Sharing stories of failure (13:33) The ‚Äú10 dollar‚Äù game for priorities (15:24) Advice on making remote work, work (24:16) Getting buy-in for your ideas (28:33) The importance of staying open-minded (34:05) A quick summary of how to get buy-in (36:45) Fighting the good fight (38:19) Identifying customer pain points (43:08) Starting small and showing success (46:08) Launching new product lines (53:35) Atlassian‚Äôs gated process for new product ideas (58:29) How Jira stays ahead of competitors (01:04:56) Learning from failure (01:09:00) Fight club (01:10:37) Lightning roundReferenced:‚Ä¢ Jira: https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira‚Ä¢ Atlassian: https://www.atlassian.com/‚Ä¢ Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/product‚Ä¢ Ben Crowe on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-crowe-67299714/‚Ä¢ Ash Barty on X: https://twitter.com/ashbarty‚Ä¢ Atlassian‚Äôs blog, Work Life: https://www.atlassian.com/blog‚Ä¢ Lessons learned: 1,000 days of distributed at Atlassian: https://www.atlassian.com/blog/distributed-work/distributed-work-report‚Ä¢ New research: How to make time for the work that matters: https://www.atlassian.com/blog/distributed-work/calendar-redesign-experiment‚Ä¢ Atlas: https://www.atlassian.com/software/atlas‚Ä¢ Confluence: https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence‚Ä¢ Lenny‚Äôs swag store: https://lennyswag.com/‚Ä¢ What is CSAT and how do you measure it?: https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/customer/what-is-csat‚Ä¢ The UX research reckoning is here | Judd Antin (Airbnb, Meta): https://www.lennyspodcast.com/the-ux-research-reckoning-is-here-judd-antin-airbnb-meta/‚Ä¢ Charlie Sutton on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/charliesutton/‚Ä¢ Nokia 6100: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6100‚Ä¢ Compass: https://www.atlassian.com/software/compass‚Ä¢ Jira Product Discovery: https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/product-discovery‚Ä¢ Canva: https://www.canva.com/‚Ä¢ Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love: https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507‚Ä¢ Scaling People: Tactics for Management and Company Building: https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-People-Tactics-Management-Building/dp/1953953212‚Ä¢ Foundation on AppleTV+: https://tv.apple.com/us/show/foundation/umc.cmc.5983fipzqbicvrve6jdfep4x3‚Ä¢ Foundation book series: https://www.amazon.com/Foundation-3-Book-Boxed-Set-Empire/dp/0593499573‚Ä¢ Traeger smoker: https://www.traeger.com/shop/wood-pellet-grillsProduction and marketing by https://penname.co/.

In our conversation, we discuss:Systems thinking: what it is and how to apply itAdvice for product managers on fostering productive relationships with engineering managersWhy companies should treat engineers like adultsHow to best measure developer productivityWriting and its impact on his careerHow to balance writing with a demanding jobHow to develop your company valuesSome takeaways:Foster productive relationships between product managers and engineers by understanding each other‚Äôs incentives and needs. Promote open communication and collaboration to bridge the gap between different roles within the organization.The first rule of strategy is to write it down. Until it‚Äôs written down, it‚Äôs hard to measure decisions against, and it‚Äôs easy to avoid useful discussions about what needs to be improved.Utilize writing as a powerful tool for personal and professional growth. Focus on topics that genuinely excite you in order to avoid burnout.No metric is perfect, and that‚Äôs okay. Questions about the validity of metrics are an opportunity to educate people on the nuances of what‚Äôs being measured. There is much less nuance in the alternative approach: measuring nothing at all.To develop your company values, make sure they are (1) honest, (2) applicable, and (3) reversible. Avoid generic or identity values (like ‚Äúwe build good software‚Äù) that lack differentiation and fail to provide useful guidance for employees.Listen now on Apple, Spotify, Overcast, and
